# Third Anchor

**Type**: Human Settlement / Governance Center
**Region**: Northeastern Keth'toh, in a temperate valley shielded from the harshest weather
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Overview

The third and largest human settlement on Keth'toh, grown from a landing site into a proper town over two centuries. While First Anchor remains the ceremonial heart of human presence on Keth'toh, Third Anchor has become the center of governance and daily life. Most humans on Keth'toh live here or have connections here.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: A jarring blend of human prefab structures and adapted native architecture. The original landing modules still stand at the center, preserved as monuments, now surrounded by buildings that borrowed local techniques with varying success. The edges of the settlement are rougher, where the "gone native" humans live.

**Sounds**: The hum of machinery that still works. Human speech in several variant dialects. The thrum of generators powering essential systems. At night, the silence where bioluminescence should sing but doesn't—the humans suppress the local growth within their boundaries.

**Smells**: Recycled air from the climate-controlled sections, carrying hints of cultivation. Native food cooking in the outer quarters. The clean, artificial scent that humans carry, different from everything natural to Keth'toh.

**Feeling**: A place out of place. The humans have made a home here, but it never quite fits. There's pride in what they've built, but also an undercurrent of unease—they know they're guests who've stayed too long.

## Key Features

### The Monument Modules
The original landing craft, preserved at the settlement's center. Three cylindrical structures now serve as museum, government offices, and emergency shelter. They're the one thing all humans in Third Anchor agree must be protected.

### The Governance Hall
Where the settlement's leaders manage day-to-day operations. Governor Volkov-Andersen runs a practical administration focused on keeping the peace, managing resources, and maintaining relations with First Anchor.

### The Fringe
The outer ring of the settlement, where humans who have "gone native" live alongside those who trade regularly with Vel'ashi. Less policed, more welcoming to outsiders, but viewed with suspicion by the inner settlement.

### The Archive
Human records of their time on Keth'toh, including first contact documentation, settlement histories, and the curiously incomplete files on Second Anchor's evacuation.

## History

Third Anchor was founded 180 years ago when the temperate valley offered ideal conditions for long-term habitation. First Anchor, the original landing site, remained important for ceremonial purposes, and Second Anchor was established as a mining operation. Third Anchor's valley location offered the best combination of resources, shelter, and growing room.

For most of its history, Third Anchor focused on survival and gradual expansion. Relations with the Vel'ashi evolved from mutual wariness to cautious coexistence. The settlement grew, developed distinct neighborhoods for different human variants, and established the governance structures that still operate today.

Five years ago, the settlement's lead researcher, Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura, relocated her most sensitive work to Second Anchor, citing the need for better equipment and fewer distractions. Most residents think of this as eccentricity—researchers are strange people who prefer isolation. The Governor approved the move without fully understanding what it meant.

## The Other Settlements

**First Anchor** is the older, smaller sibling—the place where humanity first landed. It remains populated and serves as the ceremonial heart of human presence on Keth'toh. Major decisions, important marriages, and remembrance ceremonies are conducted there. Relations between First and Third Anchor are cordial but sometimes tense; First Anchor residents view Third Anchor as having forgotten its roots.

**Second Anchor** was a mining settlement to the west, abandoned roughly 70 years ago. The official story is that the mineral deposits were exhausted, but older residents speak of it differently—equipment malfunctions, miners who came back changed, the sealed shaft no one will explain. The settlement stood empty for decades until Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura and her research team moved in, drawn by the existing infrastructure and distance from oversight. Most Third Anchor residents don't know the research has resumed there; those who do assume it's harmless academic work.

## GM Notes

Third Anchor is **not** the campaign's climactic location—that's Second Anchor. But Third Anchor serves important functions:

**Information Hub**: The party can learn about Second Anchor's history here. Veterans remember the evacuation. The Archive has incomplete records. Rumors circulate in the Fringe.

**Supplies and Preparation**: Before heading to Second Anchor, the party might gather equipment, allies, or information here.

**Political Leverage**: If the party can convince Governor Volkov-Andersen that Hessa's research is dangerous, he has the authority to order her to stop—but he'll need evidence, not just claims.

**Human Perspective**: Third Anchor shows that humans aren't monolithic. Many would be horrified by what Hessa is doing if they knew. The party can find allies here.

**Eamon's History**: This is where Eamon served, where Oriel worked, where his investigation began. Being here should trigger memories and provide opportunities to learn that Oriel relocated to Second Anchor with Hessa's team.
