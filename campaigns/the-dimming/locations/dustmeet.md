# Dustmeet

**Type**: Trading Post / Settlement
**Region**: Eastern Keth'toh, half a day's travel south of Third Anchor, at the junction of three ancient roads
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Overview

Dustmeet is where paths converge. Built at the junction of three ancient roads - one leading north to Third Anchor, one east into Vel'ashi heartlands, and one west toward the abandoned Second Anchor - it serves as neutral ground where Vel'ashi and humans can trade without territorial complications. Its proximity to Third Anchor (half a day's walk) means regular human traffic, but its Vel'ashi governance maintains its character as native-controlled space. The settlement is Vel'ashi-run but welcomes all who come in peace and carry coin. Its architecture is a blend of salvaged pre-Collapse materials and living structures that grow and shift subtly over time.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: Buildings that seem to breathe - walls ripple with subtle color changes, rooflines curve in ways that weren't planned but feel right. Stalls and pavilions cluster around the central well. Bioluminescent growths provide soft light as darkness falls, their colors shifting from amber to blue to green.

**Sounds**: The murmur of a dozen languages and trade pidgins. The chime of currency being counted. The occasional argument cut short by watchful neighbors. At night, the settlement hums - literally, as the living structures settle into their rest cycles.

**Smells**: Spiced foods from a dozen traditions. The earthy sweetness of the living buildings. Dust from the roads, carried in on travelers' boots. The sharp ozone scent that precedes the evening light-bloom.

**Feeling**: Watchful neutrality. Everyone here is a guest, and everyone knows it. There's comfort in the shared understanding that trouble is bad for business.

## Key Features

### The Central Well
An ancient structure that predates the settlement, possibly pre-Collapse. The water it produces is always clean and slightly warm. Some say it responds to the drinker's need, though this may be superstition. The well marks the center of Dustmeet both geographically and socially.

### The Layered Rest
The largest building in Dustmeet, owned by Morvethri (known to most as "Veth"). Part inn, part trading house, part community hall. Its name comes from its construction - each generation of owners has added another layer, creating a structure that's part original stone, part grown walls, part salvaged metal. The common room can hold fifty comfortably, twice that uncomfortably.

### The Quiet Market
Where serious trades happen. Unlike the open stalls, the Quiet Market operates in private rooms rented by the hour. The Dustmeet Council takes a percentage of all trades conducted here but guarantees enforcement of agreed terms.

## Notable NPCs Here

| NPC | Role | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| Morvethri (Veth) | Innkeeper | Runs the Layered Rest, knows everyone |
| Koresh'rath | Constable | Keeps the peace, will investigate Nethara'kora's death |
| Moth-Eye Kessa | Trader | Human "gone native," deals in rare goods |

## Points of Interest

- **The Council Hall**: Small building near the well where the three council members meet. Handles disputes and licensing.
- **The Mender's Corner**: A Vel'ashi healer who treats all species, paid by trade or favor.
- **The Crossroads Shrine**: Small offerings to forgotten gods and remembered ancestors. Travelers leave tokens for safe journeys.
- **The Human Quarter**: Not separate by law, but by custom. A cluster of structures where human traders prefer to stay, with accommodations for their various adaptations.

## Encounters

### Likely Encounters
- **Traders**: Merchants from across Keth'toh, offering goods and gossip
- **Travelers**: People passing through, some with news of distant places
- **The Constable**: Koresh'rath will want to ask questions about Nethara'kora's death

### Possible Encounters
- **Mercenaries**: The humans who attacked Nethara'kora might come here looking for the artifact
- **Keth'vorah Envoy**: Once the order learns of Nethara'kora's death, they'll send someone
- **Informants**: Someone may have seen where Nethara'kora came from, or what followed her

## Secrets & Hidden Things

- The Central Well connects to something deep underground - the same network the Eth'koru points toward
- Morvethri has a hidden room in the Layered Rest used by the Keth'vorah
- Several traders in Dustmeet work as informants for different factions, including the human researchers
- The bioluminescent growths throughout the settlement are part of the nanomachine network; they dim noticeably when experiments at Second Anchor affect the system

## History

Dustmeet existed before the current settlement - the Central Well and foundation stones are pre-Collapse. After the catastrophe, survivors gathered here because the well still worked when so much else had failed. Over generations, it grew from a camp to a village to a true trading post.

The humans arrived roughly 200 years ago. Initial contact was wary, but trade proved more profitable than conflict. Dustmeet became the primary point of exchange between species, a role it maintains today.

## GM Notes

Dustmeet is the party's starting hub and likely a place they'll return to throughout the campaign. It offers:
- Information gathering through NPCs and overheard conversations
- Supplies and services before journeys
- A safe haven between dangerous expeditions
- A place where consequences of their actions can manifest (NPCs reacting to news of their deeds)

The constable Koresh'rath will be the first obstacle - they'll want to question the party about Nethara'kora's death. This isn't hostile, just bureaucratic, but it creates a choice: cooperate fully, evade questions, or leave quickly.

Dustmeet's bioluminescent lights dimming slightly (when Second Anchor runs experiments) can serve as subtle environmental storytelling - something the party might notice as the campaign progresses.
