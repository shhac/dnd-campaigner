# The Pale Reach

**Type**: Wilderness / Waypoint
**Region**: Between Dustmeet and Second Anchor, crossing the western highlands
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Overview

The Pale Reach is the informal name for the highland trail connecting Dustmeet to the abandoned settlements of the western canyons. The name comes from the shimmerwood forests that dominate the region - their light-refracting bark creates an eerie pale glow at dawn and dusk. Few travelers take this path anymore; Second Anchor has been abandoned for 70 years, and the ruins beyond hold nothing of value.

Or so most believe.

## The Journey

**Distance from Dustmeet**: Approximately 4-5 days on foot, 2-3 days with good mounts
**Terrain**: Rolling highlands transitioning to rocky canyon approaches
**Hazards**: Razorwing territory, occasional burrowing maw zones, weather exposure

### Day 1-2: The Shimmerwood Corridor
The trail leads through dense shimmerwood forest. The trees' light-refracting properties create beautiful but disorienting conditions - directions become confused, distances deceive. Vel'ashi travelers know to navigate by the feel of the ground and the direction of water flow rather than sight.

**Encounters**: Shimmerbeast herds, trillwing flocks, glintcat hunting pairs
**Points of Interest**:
- The Marker Stones: Ancient waypoints predating the Collapse, still visible despite millennia
- Traveler's Hollow: A traditional campsite with a natural spring

### Day 2-3: The Windswept Heights
The forest thins as elevation increases. The highlands are exposed to constant wind, and the vegetation shifts to low scrub and wind-shaped trees. The views are spectacular - on clear days, both Third Anchor's valley and Second Anchor's canyon rim are visible.

**Encounters**: Razorwing patrols (more common here than below), dust storms
**Points of Interest**:
- The Watch Rock: A natural formation where Vel'ashi scouts traditionally monitored human movement
- The Crossroads Cache: A Keth'vorah supply point (hidden, requires knowledge or investigation to find)

### Day 3-4: The Canyon Descent
The trail drops into the canyon system leading to Second Anchor. The environment shifts dramatically - sheltered from wind but increasingly rocky and treacherous. Native growth is more aggressive here, pushing into any abandoned structures.

**Encounters**: Echo lizards (friendly, curious), void moths (drawn to the party's artifact)
**Points of Interest**:
- The Old Road: Remnants of the supply route that once connected Second Anchor to the trading network
- The Overgrown Gate: Collapsed checkpoint from the mining era, now just a heap of metal and stone

### Day 4-5: Approach to Second Anchor
The final approach through the canyon. Signs of the abandoned settlement become visible - old signage, defunct equipment, structures being slowly consumed by vegetation. The sense of wrongness increases as the party nears the research dome.

**Encounters**: Hessa's remote sensors (if still active), signs of recent human activity
**Points of Interest**:
- The Warning Line: Faded markers indicating the boundary of Second Anchor's territory
- The First View: A high point where the settlement's layout becomes visible, including the lit Research Dome

## The Crossroads Cache (Keth'vorah Supply Point)

Hidden among the rocks of the Watch Rock formation is a small cache maintained by the Keth'vorah for their investigators. Korimeth would know to look for the recognition signs; others might find it with careful investigation.

**Contents**:
- Preserved rations (2 weeks' worth)
- Basic medical supplies (equivalent to a portable medkit)
- Sealed documents (maps, notes from previous investigators, outdated but useful)
- A recognition token (proves the bearer is on Keth'vorah business)
- Emergency instructions: "If compromised, report to..." (lists three contact points in different settlements)

**Condition**: Undisturbed for months. Nethara'kora passed through here on her way to Dustmeet but didn't have time to resupply.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: Shimmerwood forests giving way to exposed highlands, then descending into canyon shadow. The transition from living landscape to abandoned human infrastructure. The contrast between natural beauty and industrial decay.

**Sounds**: Wind - constant, varying in intensity. Trillwing calls in the forest sections. The creak of old structures settling in the canyon. Near Second Anchor, the unnatural hum of active equipment.

**Smells**: The clean scent of highland air. The earthy dampness of the canyon. As the party approaches Second Anchor, the metallic tang of machinery.

**Feeling**: Increasing isolation. The party is leaving the settled world behind and entering territory that has been abandoned - first by the original miners, then by everyone else. Whatever is ahead, they're on their own.

## GM Notes

The Pale Reach serves several purposes:

**Pacing**: The journey gives time for character development, party bonding, and worldbuilding. Don't rush through it unless the party is eager to reach Second Anchor.

**Foreshadowing**: Environmental details hint at what's coming - void moths increasing in number, the Eth'koru pulsing more intensely, the wrongness in the air.

**Resource Management**: Depleting supplies and requiring rest creates stakes. The Keth'vorah cache offers relief but also reveals information.

**Optional Encounters**: The journey can include random encounters, skill challenges (navigation, survival), or quiet moments. Match the pacing to the table's energy.

**The Void Moths**: As the party travels with the Eth'koru, void moths will be drawn to them. This is a visual cue that they're carrying something significant - the moths can sense the network, and the artifact pulses with network energy.
