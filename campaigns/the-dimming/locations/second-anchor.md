# Second Anchor

**Type**: Abandoned Settlement / Secret Research Base
**Region**: Western Keth'toh, in a mineral-rich canyon system
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Overview

An abandoned mining settlement, officially evacuated 70 years ago when the mineral deposits were "exhausted." The truth of that evacuation is murky—equipment malfunctions, miners who came back wrong, a sealed shaft no one explains. Whatever happened, the settlement stood empty for decades.

Until Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura arrived.

Five years ago, Hessa relocated her most sensitive research here. Second Anchor offers everything Third Anchor couldn't: existing infrastructure (power systems, heavy equipment, communication arrays), privacy from governance oversight, and distance from prying eyes. The mysterious reputation keeps casual visitors away. The old mining facilities provide cover for equipment that would raise questions elsewhere.

The original abandonment has nothing to do with Hessa's current work—but the settlement's history adds an unsettling layer to everything that happens here.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: Buildings half-reclaimed by native growth, vines threading through broken windows, shimmerwood saplings pushing through cracked pavement. But some structures gleam with recent repair—power restored, walls patched, equipment humming. The contrast is jarring: decay and renewal in uneasy proximity. Deep in the canyon, the sealed entrance to Shaft Seven, still marked with faded warning signs.

**Sounds**: The hum of generators where there should be silence. Wind through empty streets. Occasionally, a pulse—low, rhythmic—from the research dome that feels more like a heartbeat than machinery. At night, the clicking of echo lizards that have colonized the abandoned buildings.

**Smells**: Dust, rust, the green scent of encroaching vegetation. From the research dome: ozone and something metallic, the smell of high-energy equipment pushing limits.

**Feeling**: Wrong. This place was abandoned for reasons no one will explain, and now something new has moved in. The combination of mystery and activity creates constant unease. Even Hessa's team, who know exactly what they're doing, don't like being here after dark.

## Key Features

### The Research Dome
Formerly the mining operation's command center, now Hessa's primary laboratory. She chose this building because its reinforced structure and existing power connections made it ideal for her scanning equipment. The dome's systems can detect and analyze the nanomachine network across a wide area—and, if activated, broadcast a shutdown signal.

### The Power Station
The old mining operation required significant power. The station still works, maintained now by Hessa's small support team. Without it, the research would be impossible. It's also the facility's most vulnerable point.

### The Sealed Quarters
Residential buildings left exactly as they were 70 years ago. Personal effects still on shelves. Meals half-prepared in kitchens. The evacuation was rapid—whatever happened, people left without packing. Hessa's team uses only a small cluster of refurbished buildings; the rest remain frozen in time.

### Shaft Seven
The sealed mining shaft that no one will explain. Heavy doors, multiple locks, warning signs in languages that predate the current settlers. Whatever the original miners found down there, it was enough to evacuate the entire settlement. Hessa has shown no interest in opening it—her work is above ground. But the shaft exists, waiting.

## Notable NPCs Here

| NPC | Role | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura | Lead Researcher | Believes she's saving everyone; the true threat |
| Dr. Yuki Okonkwo | Research Assistant | Has doubts she won't voice |
| Sergeant Vance | Security Lead | Former Third Anchor military, runs the small guard detail |
| Oriel Vance | Research Technician | Eamon's missing friend; chose this work over their friendship |

## Points of Interest

- **The Array**: Scanning equipment on the canyon rim, monitoring nanomachine network activity
- **The Archives**: Mining records from before evacuation, might contain clues about what happened
- **The Cold Storage**: Equipment and supplies cached for the research team, including emergency provisions
- **The Old Commissary**: Where the research team takes meals, the one social space in an otherwise grim facility

## Encounters

### Likely Encounters
- **Research Staff**: Nervous scientists who know something is wrong but trust Hessa's vision
- **Security Personnel**: A small team, well-armed but spread thin across the facility
- **Automated Defenses**: Motion sensors and alarms Hessa installed; no lethal measures yet

### Possible Encounters
- **Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura**: If intruders are detected, she'll want to understand them before eliminating them
- **Oriel Vance**: If Eamon is present, this reunion will be complicated
- **Something from Below**: The sealed shaft has been quiet for 70 years. That doesn't mean it's empty.

## Secrets & Hidden Things

- The shutdown protocol is nearly complete—Hessa needs only a few more readings before she can act
- Dr. Okonkwo has been secretly documenting concerns about the research; her notes could be leveraged
- The mining archives contain references to "deep interference" that match Hessa's current readings—the original miners may have detected the same network
- Oriel Vance volunteered for isolation at Second Anchor because they believe in the work, not because they were ordered
- Sergeant Vance (no relation to Oriel) suspects the research is dangerous but follows orders
- The power station has a manual override that could shut down the entire facility—but it's in the most heavily monitored area

## History

Second Anchor was established 150 years ago as a mining operation. The canyon's mineral deposits were valuable, and for decades the settlement thrived. Then, 70 years ago, something changed.

The official records are incomplete. Equipment malfunctions that followed no pattern. Miners who returned from deep shafts with gaps in memory or subtly altered personalities. Strange readings from instruments that shouldn't have been detecting anything. Finally, an incident in Shaft Seven—details redacted—that led to immediate evacuation.

The settlement was never officially decommissioned. Ownership transferred through bureaucratic channels until it became effectively ownerless—perfect for Hessa's purposes when she needed somewhere to work without oversight.

Whatever happened 70 years ago is **unrelated** to Hessa's current research. She chose this location for practical reasons: infrastructure, privacy, distance from Third Anchor's governance. But the settlement's history creates an atmosphere that affects everyone who works here. The old mystery and the new threat exist in parallel, each making the other feel more ominous.

## The Old Mystery vs. The New Threat

**The Original Abandonment** (70 years ago):
- Caused by something the miners encountered deep underground
- Related to the nanomachine network, but a different phenomenon
- Shaft Seven was sealed because of what was found, not because of anything Hessa has done
- This mystery can be explored or ignored—it's flavor, not the main plot

**Hessa's Research** (current):
- Focused on understanding and disabling the surface-level network
- Uses the old infrastructure but has no connection to whatever happened below
- The threat is her shutdown protocol, not the sealed shaft

GMs can choose to connect these threads or leave them separate. The abandoned settlement works as creepy atmosphere even if the old mystery is never solved.

## GM Notes

Second Anchor is the campaign's true climactic location. The journey here should feel like entering enemy territory—isolated, eerie, and increasingly dangerous.

**Approach Options**:
- Stealth through the overgrown sections, avoiding the maintained perimeter
- Infiltration by posing as traders or researchers (difficult given the isolation)
- Direct approach, forcing confrontation early
- Sabotage of the power station to cripple the facility

**Resolution Options**:
- Convince Hessa she's wrong (very difficult—she's brilliant and committed)
- Convince her team to turn on her (possible—some have doubts)
- Destroy the research equipment (stops the threat but makes permanent enemies)
- Disable the power station (buys time, doesn't resolve the underlying conflict)
- Find evidence in the archives that changes the equation

**The Eth'koru** will point directly at the Research Dome. The artifact is responding to Hessa's scanning equipment, which generates signatures similar to ancient network control systems.

**Oriel Vance** is here and healthy—they chose this work because they believed in it. Eamon will have to confront the fact that his friend wasn't kidnapped or coerced. This should be an emotional moment, not just a rescue.

**Shaft Seven** can remain sealed for the entire campaign, or you can use it as a wild card. What's down there is left deliberately undefined—ancient Keth'ashi technology, something the nanomachine network quarantined, a pocket of reality that works differently. Use it or don't, as the story requires.
