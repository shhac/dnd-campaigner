# Dust-Walker Cael

> **Initial State**: This NPC is documented in their Act 2 starting condition. The GM should update based on how the story has progressed and any events in Third Anchor.

**Role**: Potential Ally / Guide
**Location**: The Fringe, Third Anchor
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human (Baseline, culturally adapted) |
| **Occupation** | Fringe Guide |
| **Age** | 43 |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A weathered man whose appearance marks him as neither fully human nor Vel'ashi, but something between. His skin has the deep tan of someone who spends more time under open sky than under roofs, and his clothing blends human utility with Vel'ashi aesthetics - a worn travel coat adapted with native textiles, boots reinforced with a material that seems to shift slightly in different light. His hair is sun-bleached brown, kept in a practical braid, and his beard is trimmed short. His eyes are pale grey, watchful, with the permanent squint of someone who reads terrain more than text. He carries himself with an easy looseness that suggests he's comfortable in spaces most humans find alien.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Quiet, observant, unhurried - speaks when he has something worth saying
**Motivation**: Freedom to move between worlds; he values being a bridge, not belonging entirely to either side
**Fear**: Being forced to choose sides; being trapped in one place

**Personality Traits**:
- Judges people by their actions on the trail, not their words in town
- Finds indoor spaces confining and grows restless after too long in settlements
- Genuinely enjoys teaching others to see Keth'toh the way the Vel'ashi do
- Distrusts anyone too certain about anything

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Sparse, deliberate, tends toward understatement. Uses Vel'ashi words for concepts that don't translate well to human speech. Rarely asks questions directly - observes and waits for information to emerge.
**Mannerisms**: Constantly scanning horizons and treelines, even indoors. Touches his coat when thinking, where a hidden pocket holds something he checks but never shows. Squats rather than sits when possible.
**Sample Dialogue**: "Second Anchor. Long walk. Longer if you don't know where the ground trusts your weight."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- The safe routes between Third Anchor and surrounding Vel'ashi territories
- Which paths are watched, which are forgotten, which are dangerous
- Trading post schedules and the rhythms of native settlements
- Enough Vel'ashi customs to move among them without giving offense
- General reputation of the abandoned settlements - First Anchor is pilgrimage, Second Anchor is bad luck

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- The route to Second Anchor that avoids human patrols - he's guided people there before
- The Vel'ashi have been watching Second Anchor more closely lately; something has them worried
- There's a Vel'ashi spy in the Fringe - he knows who it is but keeps the secret
- The paths between settlements aren't just roads - some follow ancient Keth'ashi routes that the nanomachine network maintains
- He's heard the dust sings differently near Second Anchor now - something changed there

### Secrets (GM only)
- His birth name was Cael Mercer-Singh; he dropped the family name when he left the inner settlement fifteen years ago
- He was once security personnel at Second Anchor, before the evacuation seventy years ago - he was a child then, evacuated with his parents who never explained what happened
- The hidden object in his coat is a small device from Second Anchor that his mother kept - it hums faintly when he's near certain ancient sites
- He suspects the research team at Second Anchor is doing something dangerous, but has no proof and no authority to stop them
- The Vel'ashi trust him more than any other human; he's guided Keth'vorah investigators through territories no human has seen in generations

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Evaluating. He's met plenty of travelers with urgent business - most don't survive their urgency. He'll watch how they treat each other and the locals before deciding if they're worth helping.
**Current Disposition**: Neutral
**History with Party**: None yet

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Scout (Monster Manual)
**AC**: 13 (natural agility + travel gear) | **HP**: 16
**Notable Abilities**:
- **Expert Navigator**: Advantage on Survival checks to navigate Keth'toh's wilderness
- **Between Worlds**: Can pass through Vel'ashi territories without triggering hostile responses
- **Hidden Paths**: Knows secret routes that reduce travel time by half, if he chooses to share them
- **Non-combatant**: Prefers to disappear rather than fight; will only engage to protect someone helpless

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Third Anchor (the Fringe), route to Second Anchor, Vel'ashi territories, possibly the Keth'vorah through past guiding work
**Potential Uses**:
- Guide the party to Second Anchor via safe routes
- Provide information about what the Vel'ashi have noticed near Second Anchor
- Introduce the party to Fringe contacts who might have other information
- Share observations about the paths themselves - how the land has changed recently
- If the party earns his trust, reveal his childhood connection to Second Anchor

## The Dust-Walker

Cael earned his title from the Vel'ashi, not the humans. In Vel'ashi tongue, it carries connotations of one who walks where the old network is thin, where the "magic" fades and only dust remains. It's both a compliment and a warning - he goes where others don't, sees what others miss, but lives in the spaces between things.

Among humans in Third Anchor, "gone native" is spoken with pity or contempt. In the Fringe, Cael is respected - a survivor, a guide, someone who figured out how to belong to both worlds by belonging fully to neither.

## Key Relationships

### The Fringe Community
He's the one people come to when they need to move quietly. Refugees from the inner settlement, traders with unofficial goods, researchers who want to see native territories without drawing attention. He doesn't ask why, only whether they can keep up.

### The Vel'ashi
Several Vel'ashi communities know him by sight and grant him passage. This trust was earned over decades of honest dealing. He's guided their investigators through human territories, helped negotiate misunderstandings, and never betrayed a confidence. In return, they've shown him paths most humans will never see.

### Governor Volkov-Andersen
The governor knows Cael exists but considers him a minor nuisance - a reminder that some humans reject the settlement's values. Cael prefers it that way. Attention from administration means questions, and questions mean choosing sides.

### The Research Team
Cael guided some early members of Dr. Tolvren-Nakamura's team to Second Anchor before they established regular routes. He didn't like what he saw in their eyes - the same intensity his mother had when she talked about the old settlement. He hasn't guided anyone there since, though he's watched the traffic increase.

## Hiring Cael

Cael doesn't work for credits alone. He'll want to know:
- Why they're going where they're going
- What they'll do when they get there
- Whether they can be trusted not to make things worse

**What convinces him**:
- Honesty about their purpose, even if incomplete
- Respect for the land and its people
- Evidence they're not working for the research team
- Recommendation from someone he trusts (another Fringe dweller, a Vel'ashi contact)

**What warns him off**:
- Lies he can detect (and he's good at detecting them)
- Casual disrespect toward the Vel'ashi or the Fringe community
- Connections to human administration
- Too much interest in the research team at Second Anchor

**His Price**: Information. What do they know about what's happening at Second Anchor? What have they learned about the artifact they carry? He'll trade passage for knowledge.

## GM Notes

Cael is a practical resource - he can get the party to Second Anchor faster and safer than they'd manage alone. But he's also a thematic bridge between worlds, embodying the campaign's tension between human and Vel'ashi perspectives.

**Using Cael effectively**:
- He can foreshadow Second Anchor's danger through his observations and childhood memories
- His trust in the Vel'ashi offers an alternative to the human researchers' fear
- His device (the object from his mother) could react to the Eth'koru or ancient sites, adding mystery
- He can introduce the party to Vel'ashi contacts who have different perspectives on the threat

**If the party earns his trust**:
- He'll reveal his connection to Second Anchor's evacuation
- He might share his theory that the research team is repeating old mistakes
- He could guide them through territories that would otherwise be inaccessible
- In extreme circumstances, he might join them for the final confrontation

**What he won't do**:
- Betray Vel'ashi who have trusted him
- Guide anyone he believes will cause harm to Keth'toh
- Return to Second Anchor's depths - his childhood memories are warning enough
