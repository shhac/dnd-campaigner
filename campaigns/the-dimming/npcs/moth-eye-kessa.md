# Moth-Eye Kessa

> **Initial State**: This NPC is documented in their starting condition. The GM should update based on any interactions with the party or events in Dustmeet.

**Role**: Information Source/Merchant
**Location**: Dustmeet (often near the Quiet Market or Central Well)
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human (Dark-Adapted variant) |
| **Occupation** | Trader specializing in rare goods |
| **Age** | 47 |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A pale human woman with oversized silver-grey eyes that catch the light like a moth's wings at dusk - the source of her trade name. Her white hair is worn in intricate braids threaded with Vel'ashi-style bioluminescent beads that pulse softly in dim light. She dresses in layered native garments of deep blues and greys, practical for her light-sensitive eyes, with the distinctive long cuts that allow Vel'ashi camouflage abilities she doesn't possess. Her face bears subtle cosmetic markings in violet pigment - an imitation of Vel'ashi skin patterns that some find endearing and others find presumptuous.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Quiet, observant, speaks more through careful questions than statements
**Motivation**: Maintain her position as a trusted bridge between cultures while building wealth for independence
**Fear**: Being forced to choose sides; losing her place in both worlds

**Personality Traits**:
- Listens three times longer than she speaks
- Treats information as the most valuable currency - never gives it for free
- Genuinely respects Vel'ashi culture, not performing it for advantage
- Keeps her human heritage private but not hidden

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Soft and deliberate, with Vel'ashi loan-words woven naturally into her speech. Avoids contractions. Uses the Vel'ashi plural "we" when referring to Dustmeet residents.
**Mannerisms**: Blinks slowly when thinking. Tilts her head at slight angles when listening, like a duskglider tracking prey by sound. Keeps her hood up outdoors even in dim light.
**Sample Dialogue**: "That is not a question I can answer freely, but perhaps we might reach an arrangement. What have you seen, traveler, that you think no one noticed?"

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- She's lived among the Vel'ashi for over twenty years
- She trades in rare goods: salvaged artifacts, pre-Collapse trinkets, exotic medicines, information
- She has contacts in both Third Anchor and deeper Vel'ashi territories
- She speaks fluent Vel'ashi and knows their customs intimately

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- She left Third Anchor after a falling out with her family over her choice to live among "aliens"
- She has heard rumors of humans operating in areas they shouldn't be - west of Dustmeet
- She knew Nethara'kora slightly - bought information from her twice before
- She knows the bioluminescent growths in Dustmeet have been dimming intermittently for weeks

### Secrets (GM only)
- She has a contact inside Second Anchor - a maintenance worker who trades her goods and gossip from the abandoned settlement
- Her contact mentioned "researchers" moving equipment into the old mine shafts months ago
- She suspects something serious is happening but hasn't connected it to Nethara'kora's death yet
- She was approached by the same "hard-eyed humans" who paid Morvethri - she refused their coin and warned Veth, but too late

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Cautious interest - strangers who were present at a Keth'vorah investigator's death are worth watching
**Current Disposition**: Neutral, potentially helpful for the right price
**History with Party**: None yet; may have observed them from a distance when Nethara'kora died

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Spy (Monster Manual)
**AC**: 12 | **HP**: 27
**Notable Abilities**: Superior Darkvision (120 ft, Dark-Adapted trait), Cunning Action, Sneak Attack (2d6)

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Nethara'kora's investigation, Second Anchor activity, human-Vel'ashi relations
**Potential Uses**:
- Can provide early hints about unusual human activity west of Dustmeet
- Might sell information about routes to Second Anchor or beyond
- Could introduce the party to contacts in human or Vel'ashi settlements
- Her contact in Second Anchor could become a significant asset later
- May reveal she was approached by the mercenaries, adding to the picture of who's hunting the artifact

## GM Notes

Kessa represents a third path in the human-Vel'ashi divide - someone who has genuinely integrated rather than just coexisting. This makes her valuable as an information broker but also vulnerable; neither side fully trusts her, and both would sacrifice her if necessary.

Her epithet "Moth-Eye" was given by the Vel'ashi - partly for her reflective dark-adapted eyes, partly because moths are drawn to light they cannot possess. Some Vel'ashi mean it affectionately; others use it to remind her she'll never truly be one of them.

She can serve as an early lead toward Second Anchor without revealing too much. She knows *something* is happening but not what. If the party treats her well and pays fairly, she might eventually reveal her contact inside the old settlement - a significant advantage for infiltration.

Key hooks:
- "I heard the researchers are studying the old shafts. Curious place for science, an abandoned mine."
- "The lights have been flickering. Not just here - travelers say it happens in other settlements too. The Vel'ashi won't talk about it, but they're worried."
- "Someone offered me good coin for information about a Vel'ashi woman traveling alone. I told them nothing. But others weren't so careful."

Her Dark-Adapted traits make her useful for any night operations or underground exploration. If the party earns her trust, she might offer to guide them - for a price.
