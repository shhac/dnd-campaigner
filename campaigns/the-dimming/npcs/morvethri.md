## Appearance

A broad Vel'ashi woman who has let her shape-shifting abilities settle into comfortable roundness. Her skin carries the warm amber tones of someone who has spent decades in the Layered Rest's mellow light. Her hands are always busy - wiping a surface, sorting inventory, adjusting cushions. She wears layered robes in ochre and rust, practical and stain-resistant.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Warm but watchful, the hospitality of a veteran who has seen every kind of trouble
**Motivation**: Keep her establishment profitable, peaceful, and out of anyone's disputes
**Fear**: Being drawn into conflicts between factions - she has worked too hard to lose everything

**Personality Traits**:
- Treats everyone the same until they give her reason not to
- Remembers faces, names, and debts with perfect clarity
- Believes most problems can be solved with a warm meal and careful listening

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Unhurried, uses food and drink metaphors, calls everyone "friend" until they're not
**Mannerisms**: Dries her hands on her apron constantly, even when they're dry. Looks over her shoulder before saying anything interesting.
**Sample Dialogue**: "Trouble's like bad wine, friend - it only gets worse if you let it sit. Tell me what you need, and we'll see what I can pour."

## What They Know

- She knows everyone who passes through Dustmeet
- She maintains strict neutrality - her establishment serves all who can pay
- She has connections to most local traders and knows the gossip

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- She recognized Nethara'kora as Keth'vorah when she stumbled in
- She has seen "certain types" - hard-eyed humans - passing through recently, asking questions
- She knows the trails between Dustmeet and the human settlements
- She has a cousin who "went native" to the humans and occasionally sends word

### Secrets (GM only)
- She has quietly helped the Keth'vorah in the past, providing safe rooms and passing messages
- The "hard-eyed humans" paid her well for information about a Vel'ashi woman traveling alone - she feels guilty now
- She knows more about the old roads than she lets on; her family were traders before the Layered Rest

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Cautious sympathy - they're caught up in something, but she doesn't know whose side they're on yet
**Current Disposition**: Neutral, leaning helpful
**History with Party**: Witnessed Nethara'kora's death together with them

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Commoner
**AC**: 10 | **HP**: 4
**Notable Abilities**: None combat-relevant; excellent at reading people

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: The opening scene, Dustmeet as a location, potential information about the humans
**Potential Uses**:
- Can provide information about Dustmeet and its people
- May know the route Nethara'kora traveled
- Could connect the party with traders heading toward human territory
- Might reveal she accidentally helped the mercenaries find Nethara'kora (source of guilt/redemption arc)

## GM Notes

Morvethri (called "Veth" by most humans and casual acquaintances) is a good first contact for the party - someone with local knowledge who isn't aligned with any faction strongly enough to push them in a particular direction. Her guilt over possibly helping the mercenaries find Nethara'kora gives her motivation to help the party, though she won't admit this easily.

She can provide practical assistance: directions, supplies, introductions to traders. She can also warn them about the constable (Koresh'rath) who will want to question them about the death.

If the party treats her well, she may eventually admit what she knows about the "hard-eyed humans" - which could be an early lead toward understanding who attacked Nethara'kora.
