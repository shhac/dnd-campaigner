# Oriel Vance

> **Initial State**: This NPC is documented in their Act 3 starting condition. The GM should update based on how the story has progressed and any events that affect Second Anchor before the party arrives.

**Role**: Ally (complicated) / Emotional Catalyst
**Location**: Research Dome, Second Anchor
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human (Photosynthetic Variant) |
| **Occupation** | Research Technician, Planetary Substrate Studies |
| **Age** | 28 |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

Oriel shares Eamon's Photosynthetic heritage - skin with a greenish undertone, amber eyes that catch the light, hair streaked with gold-green highlights. But where Eamon has hardened into a soldier, Oriel kept their softer edges. They're slighter of build, with expressive features that make every emotion visible. Three months of underground work at Second Anchor have left them paler than they should be, the greenish tint fading toward grey, dark circles under their eyes speaking to light-deprivation and long hours. They wear practical lab clothing - coveralls, tool belt, data pad always in hand - and move with the restless energy of someone who's been indoors too long.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Warm, earnest, quick to explain - but lately carrying a weight that dims their natural brightness
**Motivation**: To understand something that matters; to contribute to work that could protect everyone on Keth'toh
**Fear**: That they made the wrong choice; that Eamon is out there looking for them and doesn't understand why they stayed

**Personality Traits**:
- Explains things with their whole body - gesturing, drawing diagrams in the air, physically demonstrating concepts
- Cannot leave a puzzle unsolved; will work through meals and sleep to find an answer
- Apologizes too much, especially when they haven't done anything wrong
- Still keeps Eamon's last message saved on their personal device, undeleted but unread for months

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Quick, enthusiastic, prone to tangents. Uses technical jargon unconsciously, then backs up to explain when they notice confusion. Swallows words when nervous. When tired or stressed, their sentences fragment - starts and stops, unfinished thoughts.

**Mannerisms**: Pushes hair back constantly (nervous habit). Taps fingers on surfaces when thinking. When listening intently, tilts their head slightly - a childhood habit Eamon would recognize immediately.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- (excited) "Wait, wait - look at *this*. See how the signal propagates? It's not random, there's a pattern, it's almost like - okay, sorry, backing up. So the substrate - you know about the substrate, right? The nanomachine network?"
- (defensive) "I know how it looks. I *know*. But if you'd seen what Dr. Tolvren-Nakamura showed me - the data, Eamon. It's real. Something is happening."
- (breaking) "I didn't... I should have... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- They're part of Dr. Tolvren-Nakamura's research team studying the planetary substrate
- They relocated to Second Anchor five years ago (after the team, not with the original move)
- Their work involves analyzing nanomachine network activity patterns
- They believe the research is important for the safety of all species on Keth'toh

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- They chose to cut contact with everyone outside the facility, including Eamon
- The research has revealed disturbing patterns - the network appears to be "waking up"
- They have doubts about the shutdown protocol but trust Dr. Tolvren-Nakamura's judgment
- They've been having nightmares - about the network, about what happens if they're wrong, about Eamon's face when he learns the truth
- They almost left twice; both times, they convinced themselves to stay "just until we confirm the readings"

### Secrets (GM only)
- They've secretly kept a journal documenting their doubts - it's hidden in their quarters
- They recognize that their decision to go silent was partly cowardice; explaining felt too hard
- They've noticed inconsistencies in the data that they haven't reported to Hessa - readings that suggest the network might be *responding* to interference rather than preparing an attack
- They still love Eamon - platonically, deeply - and the guilt of abandoning him is eating them alive
- Part of why they believe so fervently in the research is because the alternative means their sacrifice was meaningless

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: If Eamon is present, shock and shame will overwhelm everything else. Eyes wide, frozen, unable to speak. If Eamon isn't present, they'll be nervous but professional - another unexpected visitor to a facility that isn't supposed to have visitors.

**Current Disposition**: Conflicted. Torn between loyalty to the research, guilt about Eamon, and growing uncertainty about whether they're on the right side.

**History with Party**:
- Eamon: Childhood friends from Third Anchor. Grew up together in the Photosynthetic quarter. Went through basic training together. Oriel was the person who could make Eamon laugh, who reminded him there was life outside duty. They know him better than almost anyone.
- Others: No prior connection.

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Commoner with technical expertise
**AC**: 10 | **HP**: 8
**Notable Abilities**:
- Technical Proficiency: Advantage on checks involving the research equipment
- Photosynthetic Metabolism: As per human variant rules
- Non-combatant: Will not fight under normal circumstances; freezes under pressure

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Eamon's personal quest, Hessa's research team, the moral complexity of the antagonist's position

**Potential Uses**:
- Emotional anchor for Eamon's character arc - the reunion forces him to confront his assumptions
- Inside information about the research facility, security routines, and Hessa's plans
- Their hidden journal could provide evidence of inconsistencies in Hessa's conclusions
- Could be convinced to help sabotage the shutdown protocol if given compelling evidence
- Represents the human cost on both sides - someone who genuinely believed they were doing the right thing

## The Reunion

When Eamon and Oriel meet, this is the emotional climax of Eamon's personal arc. Some key beats:

**Oriel's Initial Reaction**:
- Shock. Shame. Relief and terror in equal measure.
- They've rehearsed this conversation a hundred times and suddenly can't remember any of it.
- First words might be: "Eamon. I... How did you..." (unable to finish)

**What Oriel Needs Eamon to Understand**:
- They weren't coerced. They chose this.
- The research felt more important than anything - even friendship.
- They're not asking for forgiveness. They know they don't deserve it.

**What Oriel Doesn't Say (But Is True)**:
- They've missed Eamon every single day.
- Going silent was the hardest thing they've ever done.
- Part of them hoped Eamon would come find them, even as they dreaded it.

**Possible Outcomes**:
- Eamon rejects them: Oriel accepts it. They expected this. It doesn't stop it from breaking them.
- Eamon forgives them: Oriel doesn't believe they deserve it. This may take time to process.
- Eamon asks them to help stop Hessa: The hardest choice. Betray the work they sacrificed everything for? Or help someone they love?

## GM Notes

Oriel is designed to make the situation at Second Anchor emotionally complex. It's easy to cast Hessa as the villain, but Oriel shows that good people genuinely believe in what's happening here. They're not brainwashed, not coerced, not stupid - they made a choice based on evidence that seemed compelling.

**Key Dramatic Questions**:
- Can Eamon forgive someone who chose work over friendship?
- What does Oriel do when their certainty crumbles?
- Is their love for Eamon strong enough to overcome their commitment to the research?

**Oriel's Arc Options**:
1. **Redemption through betrayal**: Oriel helps stop the shutdown, repairing their relationship with Eamon by choosing him this time
2. **Tragic commitment**: Oriel can't abandon the work; dies believing they were right (or worse, lives to see they were wrong)
3. **Reconciliation without resolution**: Oriel and Eamon reconnect, but the damage to their relationship is permanent - they can be civil, maybe even fond, but never what they were

**Playing Oriel**:
- Lead with guilt. Even when defending their choices, the guilt bleeds through.
- They want to be convinced they were wrong - it would be a relief.
- Physical affection comes naturally to them (unlike Eamon); they might reach for his hand, then stop themselves.
- When the facade cracks, it cracks completely. Ugly crying, apologies, everything they've been holding back.

**The Journal**:
If the party finds Oriel's hidden journal, it contains:
- Early entries full of excitement about the research
- Growing unease as the shutdown protocol developed
- Specific data anomalies that contradict Hessa's conclusions
- Personal entries about missing Eamon, justifying the silence, hating themselves for it
- The last entry: "If I'm wrong about this, I don't know how to live with what I've done."
