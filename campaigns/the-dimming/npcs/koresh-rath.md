# Koresh'rath (Trade Name: Rath)

**Role**: Authority/Potential Obstacle
**Location**: Dustmeet
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Vel'ashi |
| **Occupation** | Constable of Dustmeet |
| **Age** | 84 (mature adult, experienced) |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A lean Vel'ashi man with the stillness of a practiced observer. His skin carries muted grey-violet tones that rarely shift - decades of training have given him exceptional control over his involuntary color responses. He wears practical clothing in the official colors of the Dustmeet Council (deep amber trim on earth tones) and carries a weighted staff that serves as both symbol of office and practical tool.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Patient, methodical, not easily rattled
**Motivation**: Keep Dustmeet safe and orderly; protect the community he's served for decades
**Fear**: Something he can't handle - a threat too large for Dustmeet's modest resources

**Personality Traits**:
- Asks questions in a way that gives people rope to hang themselves
- Remembers every face that's passed through Dustmeet in the last decade
- Believes most problems come from misunderstandings that careful questioning can resolve

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Unhurried, thoughtful pauses between questions. Never raises his voice - doesn't need to. Uses questions rather than accusations: "And then what happened?" "Help me understand..."

**Mannerisms**: Taps his staff twice when thinking. Makes eye contact that's steady without being aggressive. Positions himself so he can see the exits.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "A Keth'vorah investigator dies in my jurisdiction, and an ancient artifact appears in strangers' hands. You can see why I have questions."
- "I'm not accusing anyone of anything. I'm trying to understand what happened. Help me understand."
- "Dustmeet is neutral ground. I intend to keep it that way. That means everyone gets the same treatment."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- He's been Dustmeet's constable for thirty-two years
- He answers to the Dustmeet Council, but they trust his judgment
- He knows everyone who passes through and notices when patterns change
- He's fair - treats Vel'ashi and humans equally, which some find unusual

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- He's aware of "hard-eyed humans" asking questions recently
- He knows Nethara'kora was Keth'vorah but didn't know her specific mission
- He has contacts who can get messages to Third Anchor quickly
- He suspects something larger is happening but lacks the resources to investigate

### Secrets (GM only)
- He recognized the Eth'koru from old stories his grandmother told - he knows it's significant, even if he doesn't know why
- He's already sent word to the Dustmeet Council; they'll want to discuss the artifact
- He's worried about what happens when the Keth'vorah come looking for their investigator's body and possessions
- He has a quiet arrangement with Morvethri - she tells him about unusual travelers, he protects her establishment

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Professional suspicion - they were present at a death, they hold something valuable, they're strangers. None of that is illegal, but it's worth investigating.

**Current Disposition**: Neutral but watchful

**History with Party**: None before Nethara'kora's death

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Veteran (modified)
**AC**: 14 (leather armor + shield) | **HP**: 38
**Notable Abilities**:
- Multiattack (2 staff attacks)
- Alert (can't be surprised, +5 to initiative)
- Observant (passive Perception 20)

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: The opening scene, Dustmeet authority, potential early pressure on the party

**Potential Uses**:
- Can detain the party for questioning (creating tension without violence)
- Can provide information about Dustmeet and the region
- Can warn them that holding a Keth'vorah artifact will draw attention
- Might later become an ally if the party proves trustworthy
- Could provide safe passage documents if convinced of their mission's importance

## GM Notes

Koresh'rath is the first authority figure the party encounters after receiving the Eth'koru. His role is to create productive tension without railroading. He wants to understand what happened; he's not trying to arrest them or take the artifact. But he will ask pointed questions, and he'll remember if they lie to him.

### Questioning Approach
He'll interview witnesses first (Morvethri, other patrons), then approach the party. He'll already know the basic facts. His questions will probe for:
- Who they are and why they're in Dustmeet
- Their relationship with Nethara'kora (strangers or known to her?)
- Why she gave them the artifact instead of someone else
- What they intend to do next

### Outcomes
- **Cooperative party**: He lets them go with a warning to be careful. The artifact makes them targets. He may offer useful information about the region.
- **Evasive party**: He grows more suspicious. May insist they stay in Dustmeet until he's satisfied. Doesn't have the authority to take the artifact, but he can make leaving difficult.
- **Hostile party**: Calls for backup. Dustmeet has a small militia. Doesn't want a fight, but won't be intimidated.

The best outcome for the story is cooperative - Koresh'rath as a brief obstacle who becomes a source of useful local knowledge.
