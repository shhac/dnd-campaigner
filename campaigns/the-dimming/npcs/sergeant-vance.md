# Sergeant Vance

> **Initial State**: This NPC is documented in their Act 3 starting condition. The GM should update based on how the story has progressed and any events that affect Second Anchor before the party arrives.

**Role**: Potential Obstacle / Potential Ally
**Location**: Second Anchor (abandoned settlement / research base)
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human (Baseline) |
| **Occupation** | Security Lead, Second Anchor Research Facility |
| **Age** | 42 |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A weathered man with the bearing of someone who spent twenty years taking orders before giving them. His dark hair is cropped short in military fashion, now shot through with grey at the temples. A thin scar runs from his left eyebrow to his hairline—old shrapnel, he says, from a mining accident that wasn't quite an accident. His eyes are brown and watchful, the kind that check exits and count heads without conscious thought. He keeps his uniform clean but practical, Third Anchor military insignia removed, replaced with nothing.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Professional, reserved, observant
**Motivation**: Complete his contract honorably; protect his people
**Fear**: That he's protecting something that shouldn't exist; that his loyalty has been misplaced

**Personality Traits**:
- Speaks only when necessary; his silences are often more telling than his words
- Treats every subordinate the same—with firm, impersonal fairness
- Follows the chain of command, but privately notes when orders feel wrong
- Keeps a personal log of everything that happens at Second Anchor, "for the record"

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Clipped, military cadence. Uses "ma'am" and "sir" even when he outranks someone. Avoids contractions when giving orders but relaxes slightly in private conversation.
**Mannerisms**: Stands with hands clasped behind his back. Taps his thumb against his forefinger when thinking something he won't say aloud. Checks the time more often than necessary.
**Sample Dialogue**: "My job is perimeter security, not asking questions. But if you're asking whether I sleep well out here? No. I don't."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- He commands the six-person security detail at Second Anchor
- He served fifteen years in Third Anchor's territorial guard before taking this contract
- He reports to Dr. Tolvren-Nakamura but keeps a professional distance from the research
- The facility is off-limits to unauthorized personnel; he enforces this without exception

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- The research makes him uneasy—equipment that pulses like a heartbeat, readings that make the scientists argue in whispers
- Two of his guards have requested transfer; he denied them because replacements don't exist out here
- Dr. Okonkwo has tried to talk to him about her concerns; he listened but can't act on civilian worries
- He doesn't know exactly what Hessa is building, but he knows it's meant to affect the entire planet

### Secrets (GM only)
- He keeps a personal journal documenting irregularities—not as evidence against anyone, but as insurance if things go wrong
- He's noticed the Vel'ashi tech responds to certain equipment in ways the scientists don't discuss openly
- If presented with clear evidence that the research will cause mass casualties, his oath to Third Anchor's "protect and serve" mandate would override his contract
- He has no family connection to Oriel Vance; the shared surname is pure coincidence (common among Third Anchor settlers)
- He's already planned evacuation routes for his team if the facility needs to be abandoned quickly

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Hostile—intruders are intruders, regardless of their reasons
**Current Disposition**: Unknown (hasn't met party yet)
**History with Party**: None directly; he was not involved in the mercenary operations

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Veteran (Monster Manual)
**AC**: 17 (breastplate, shield) | **HP**: 58
**Notable Abilities**:
- **Tactical Command**: Can use a bonus action to grant an ally within 30 feet advantage on their next attack roll
- **Military Training**: Proficient with all standard weapons and armor
- **Alert**: Cannot be surprised while conscious; +5 to initiative
- **Steady Under Fire**: Advantage on saves against being frightened

**Equipment**: Breastplate, shield, longsword, crossbow (20 bolts), signaling whistle, restraints, facility keycard

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Second Anchor security, Hessa's research operation, potential facility infiltration
**Potential Uses**:
- Primary obstacle if the party attempts direct approach to the Research Dome
- Could be convinced to stand down if shown evidence of the research's true danger
- His security logs could provide evidence of irregularities
- Might help evacuate personnel if convinced the facility must be shut down
- His planned evacuation routes could become useful information for the party

## GM Notes

Sergeant Vance represents the classic "soldier following orders" moral question. He's not evil—he's professional. He took a contract, he does his job, he doesn't ask questions above his pay grade. But he's also not blind. He knows something is wrong at Second Anchor. He just doesn't have enough information to justify mutiny.

**Ways to resolve his opposition:**

1. **Show him evidence**: If the party can demonstrate what the shutdown protocol will actually do, his core values (protecting people) override his contract loyalty. He needs proof, not assertions.

2. **Appeal to his doubts**: He's already uncomfortable. A skilled persuader who validates his concerns rather than demanding immediate betrayal might find him willing to "look the other way" at a crucial moment.

3. **Go through Dr. Okonkwo**: She's tried to talk to him before. If she approached him with concrete evidence (that the party provides), he'd take her more seriously than strangers.

4. **Overwhelm him**: He has six guards, spread thin across a large facility. A coordinated strike could neutralize security—but this makes enemies and may alert Hessa.

5. **Offer him an out**: He's a contractor, not a true believer. If someone with authority (the Governor, for instance) countermanded his orders, he'd comply without hesitation.

**He is NOT related to Oriel Vance.** The shared surname should be addressed if anyone asks—it's a common name among Third Anchor families, descended from the same colony ship passenger manifest. If Eamon mentions Oriel, Vance will know who they are ("the research technician") but won't have any personal connection to invoke.

**If things go badly**: Vance won't die for Hessa's research. If the facility is clearly compromised, his priority shifts to evacuating his people and the non-combatant staff. He could become an unlikely ally in the chaos of a collapsing operation—the kind of man who puts aside yesterday's conflict to get survivors out alive.
