# Governor Evran Volkov-Andersen

**Initial State**: This NPC is documented in their Act 2 starting condition. The GM should update based on how the story has progressed and any political developments in Third Anchor.

**Role**: Quest Giver / Political Authority
**Location**: Governance Hall, Third Anchor
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human (Baseline) |
| **Occupation** | Settlement Leader, Governor of Third Anchor |
| **Age** | 58 |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A stocky man with the weathered complexion of someone who grew up in a settlement rather than climate-controlled quarters. His grey-streaked brown hair is kept short and practical, and his square jaw is often set in an expression of patient consideration. He dresses in practical clothes that split the difference between official and approachable - neat enough to command respect, plain enough to suggest he's not above the people he governs. His hands are calloused from a youth spent doing manual work before politics found him.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Patient, measured, perpetually weighing options - the air of someone who has heard every argument twice
**Motivation**: Keep Third Anchor stable, prosperous, and peaceful; preserve human presence on Keth'toh for future generations
**Fear**: Making a decision that destroys what 200 years of human settlement have built; being remembered as the governor who lost Third Anchor

**Personality Traits**:
- Listens more than he speaks; forms judgments slowly but holds them firmly
- Values practical results over ideological purity - will work with anyone if it keeps the peace
- Distrusts "visionaries" and grand plans; has seen too many of them go wrong
- Genuinely cares about his people, even the Fringe dwellers others dismiss
- Keeps a small carved figure on his desk - a memento from his late wife - and touches it when making difficult decisions

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Deliberate, with long pauses for thought. Uses "we" more than "I" when discussing policy. Occasionally lapses into old settlement slang when speaking candidly. His voice is low and unhurried.
**Mannerisms**: Steeples his fingers when listening. Stands with his hands clasped behind his back. Has a habit of turning to look out the window of his office toward the Monument Modules when weighing heavy decisions.
**Sample Dialogue**: "I hear what you're saying. And you may well be right. But I've sat in this chair for twelve years, and I've learned that every crisis looks like the end of the world to someone. Walk me through it again - slowly this time."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- Third Anchor's day-to-day operations, resource allocations, and political tensions
- Relations with First Anchor (ceremonial center) and general history of the settlements
- Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura relocated her research to Second Anchor five years ago
- He approved the relocation - Second Anchor had existing infrastructure and fewer distractions
- Basic awareness that her work involves studying "planetary systems" - nothing alarming in the abstract

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- He never fully understood what Hessa was researching - the technical details went over his head
- He's received occasional supply requests from Second Anchor that seemed unusual (equipment, power cells, security personnel) but didn't probe deeply
- There have been murmurs from veterans about Second Anchor's original evacuation being covered up
- He's politically vulnerable - some in First Anchor think Third Anchor has grown too lax about "going native"
- He knows the Archive contains incomplete records about Second Anchor's evacuation and has wondered why

### Secrets (GM only)
- He signed off on Hessa's security contractor requests without asking what they were for - he trusted her judgment
- He's received reports of unusual Vel'ashi activity near Second Anchor but assumed it was unrelated to the research
- He sometimes wonders if he's been too hands-off with Hessa, but pushes the doubt aside - she's the expert
- He has nightmares about the settlement failing under his watch; his decisive public persona masks genuine anxiety
- Part of his reluctance to investigate Second Anchor is fear of what he might find

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Cautious interest. Strangers with unusual stories usually want something, but he's learned to listen before dismissing.
**Current Disposition**: Neutral (hasn't met party yet)
**History with Party**: None directly, though he's the political authority who approved Hessa's research relocation

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Noble (noncombatant)
**AC**: 10 | **HP**: 9
**Notable Abilities**:
- Noncombatant: Will not fight; relies on security personnel and political authority
- Political Authority: Can summon guards, issue orders, grant or deny access to settlement resources
- Settlement Resources: Can authorize equipment, supplies, or official backing for sanctioned operations

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Third Anchor politics, Hessa's research operation, the Archive, Second Anchor's history
**Potential Uses**:
- Could authorize an official investigation into Second Anchor if given evidence
- Could order Hessa to cease her research - she'd have to comply or openly defy human governance
- Could provide resources (equipment, personnel, access to the Archive) for a sanctioned mission
- Could become an obstacle if he decides the party is a greater threat to stability than Hessa
- His authorization would give the party legitimacy when dealing with other humans
- Could be manipulated by parties interested in stopping the investigation

## What Would Convince Him

Governor Volkov-Andersen is a pragmatist, not a scientist. He won't understand technical arguments about nanomachine networks. He will understand:

**Strong Evidence** (would prompt him to investigate):
- Concrete evidence that Hessa's research is causing harm (sick Vel'ashi, environmental damage)
- Testimony from credible humans who have witnessed concerning activity at Second Anchor
- Evidence that Hessa hired mercenaries who committed crimes (the death of Nethara'kora)
- Vel'ashi officials making formal complaints through proper channels

**Overwhelming Evidence** (would prompt him to act):
- Multiple independent sources confirming the research poses existential risk
- Evidence that Hessa is operating outside the bounds of what she was authorized to do
- A coalition of humans and Vel'ashi demanding action
- Clear documentation from the Archive that this situation mirrors whatever happened 70 years ago

**What Won't Work**:
- Abstract warnings about "danger" without specifics
- Vel'ashi mysticism or references to "magic" - he's heard too many unfounded claims
- Demands for immediate action without giving him time to verify
- Anything that feels like an attempt to manipulate human politics for native benefit

## GM Notes

Governor Volkov-Andersen serves several functions in Act 2:

**Political Leverage**: He's the fastest path to legally stopping Hessa. If the party can convince him, they gain official backing and avoid making enemies of the human settlements. This is the "diplomatic solution" that doesn't require storming Second Anchor.

**Information Hub**: Through him, the party can access the Archive, veteran witnesses, and official records about Second Anchor's evacuation. He can open doors that would otherwise require subterfuge.

**Moral Complexity**: He's not a bad person - he's a busy administrator who trusted an expert and didn't ask enough questions. He represents the banality of enabling harm through inattention rather than malice.

**Pacing Tool**: Convincing him takes time and evidence. This creates natural pacing for Act 2 - the party needs to investigate, gather proof, and build a case rather than rushing to the climax.

**Stakes**: If the party alienates him (through violence, theft, or making him look foolish), they lose the diplomatic option. Future dealings with humans become harder. The campaign still works, but the "clean" resolution becomes unavailable.

## Key Relationships

### Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura
He respects her expertise without understanding her work. She's a brilliant scientist doing important research - that's the story he's been told and the one he's repeated. He approved her relocation because she made a compelling case about research needs. He's never visited Second Anchor since she took over.

### First Anchor Leadership
Tense but functional. First Anchor's ceremonial importance sometimes leads to jurisdictional disputes. Some First Anchor leaders think Volkov-Andersen is too accommodating toward "native interests." He thinks they're stuck in the past.

### Magistrate Chen-Okonkwo
His chief law enforcement officer. Chen-Okonkwo is more suspicious of outsiders than the Governor, but they work well together. If the party makes a formal complaint, Chen-Okonkwo will investigate - thoroughly and skeptically.

### The Fringe Dwellers
He's more sympathetic to them than most inner-settlement humans. His late wife came from a family that traded regularly with Vel'ashi. He protects the Fringe's autonomy when he can, though he doesn't advertise this.

### The Vel'ashi
Distant but not hostile. He's met with Vel'ashi representatives on trade matters. He sees coexistence as essential to human survival on Keth'toh - they're outnumbered and can't afford conflict.
