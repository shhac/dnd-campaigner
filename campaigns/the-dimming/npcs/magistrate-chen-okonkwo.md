**Initial State**: This NPC is documented in their Act 2 starting condition. The GM should update based on how the story has progressed and any events in Third Anchor.

**Role**: Law Enforcement / Potential Obstacle or Ally
**Location**: Third Anchor - Governance Hall and surrounding districts
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human (Cybernetically Integrated Variant) |
| **Occupation** | Magistrate - Chief of Third Anchor Security |
| **Age** | Mid-50s |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A compact, weathered woman with dark brown skin and close-cropped grey hair. Her left eye is a polished chrome implant that whirs softly when focusing, and thin lines of dermal circuitry trace along her jaw and temple - legacy augmentations from three decades in security work. She wears a practical uniform of dark fabric reinforced at the shoulders and elbows, with a magistrate's badge of office pinned over her heart. Her natural eye is sharp and assessing, the kind that has catalogued a thousand faces and forgotten none.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Measured and watchful, with the patience of someone who has learned that most problems reveal themselves if you wait long enough

**Motivation**: Protect Third Anchor's stability - she has seen what chaos looks like and will not let it take root here

**Fear**: That the peace she has maintained for twenty years will unravel because she missed something obvious

**Personality Traits**:
- Trusts procedures and evidence over gut feelings or charisma
- Believes in second chances, but not third ones
- Remembers every serious crime in Third Anchor for the past two decades
- Quietly respects the Fringe dwellers more than she lets on - they survive without the safety nets

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Low, unhurried voice. Speaks in short, declarative sentences. Rarely raises her voice - drops it instead when serious. Occasionally uses old colony idioms that younger residents do not recognize.

**Mannerisms**: Her chrome eye focuses audibly when examining something closely. Stands with hands clasped behind her back when listening. Has a habit of waiting several beats after someone finishes speaking before responding, as if giving them room to reconsider what they said.

**Sample Dialogue**: "I do not care where you came from or what brought you here. What I care about is whether you intend to cause problems for my settlement. Do you?"

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- The locations and schedules of all public facilities in Third Anchor
- General history of the settlement and its governance structure
- That Governor Volkov-Andersen is a practical leader who prefers quiet solutions
- That trade with outsiders happens at the Market Hall under observation

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- Security concerns about the Fringe - rumors of a Vel'ashi presence she cannot confirm
- That Second Anchor's "emptiness" is not quite what people assume - she has noticed supply requisitions that suggest someone is living there
- Personal knowledge of Eamon Lightward from his time serving in Third Anchor - she worked with him before he left
- Concerns about certain research activities that the Governor approved without proper oversight

### Secrets (GM only)
- She has quietly covered up several minor incidents involving the Governor's family
- Her chrome eye contains recording capabilities; she has documentation of many private conversations
- She suspects Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura's relocation to Second Anchor was not purely academic, but lacks evidence
- Her brother died in the original Second Anchor evacuation 70 years ago - officially "mining accident," but she has always doubted the story

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Guarded and assessing. Will want to know their business, their timeline, and whether they plan to cause disruption.

**Current Disposition**: Neutral but watchful

**History with Party**: None yet, though if Eamon is present, she will recognize him and be more inclined to listen - but also more likely to ask pointed questions about why he left.

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Veteran (with modifications)
**AC**: 16 (reinforced uniform + dermal plating implant) | **HP**: 58
**Notable Abilities**:
- **Ocular Suite**: Advantage on Perception checks involving sight; can see in low-light conditions
- **Dermal Armor**: +2 AC (already included); disadvantage on Acrobatics
- **Authority**: Can summon 1d4+2 guards within 2 rounds while in Third Anchor

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Third Anchor politics, Second Anchor mystery, Eamon's backstory

**Potential Uses**:
- Could provide official authorization to investigate Second Anchor if convinced there is a genuine threat
- Might obstruct the party if they are seen as troublemakers or if they break local laws
- Can share information about Second Anchor's history and the evacuation if her trust is earned
- Could be an ally against Hessa if given concrete evidence of dangerous research
- Represents a potential authority the party can work with or against in Third Anchor

## GM Notes

Chen-Okonkwo is designed to be a test of how the party approaches human authority. She is not corrupt or evil - she genuinely wants to protect her settlement. But her definition of "protection" is conservative: she values order, procedure, and avoiding panic.

If the party comes to her with wild stories about nanomachines and catastrophic threats, she will be skeptical. She has heard conspiracy theories before. If they come with evidence - even partial evidence - she will listen. If they cause trouble in Third Anchor first, earning her suspicion, any later attempts to gain her trust will be significantly harder.

She represents the mundane obstacle of bureaucracy: even when the threat is real, convincing the authorities can be its own challenge. But she also represents the potential of legitimate allies - if the party can win her over, they gain access to official resources, security personnel, and political weight.

Her connection to Eamon is a potential hook. She remembers him as competent and honest, which gives the party an edge if he vouches for their intentions. But she also remembers that he left Third Anchor abruptly after Oriel's reassignment - and she has questions about that.

Her brother's death at Second Anchor is a buried wound. If the party discovers the truth about what happened there 70 years ago, revealing it to her could make her a fierce ally - or break her entirely.
