# Dr. Yuki Okonkwo

> **Initial State**: This NPC is documented in their Act 3 starting condition. The GM should update based on how the story has progressed and any events that affect Second Anchor before the party arrives.

**Role**: Potential Ally (conflicted insider)
**Location**: Research Dome, Second Anchor
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human (Cybernetically Integrated Variant) |
| **Occupation** | Research Assistant, Planetary Substrate Studies |
| **Age** | 34 |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A slender woman with warm brown skin and close-cropped black hair that she keeps practically short. Her cybernetic augmentations are minimal compared to Hessa's—a single data port behind her left ear and thin dermal circuitry on her forearms that allows her to interface with lab equipment. Her eyes are dark and observant, often tracking details others miss. She carries herself with the careful posture of someone who has learned to be invisible in meetings while taking notes on everything.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Quiet, watchful, deferential in groups but sharp when cornered
**Motivation**: Uncover the truth—she became a scientist to understand things, not to destroy them
**Fear**: That she's complicit in something terrible; that her silence makes her guilty

**Personality Traits**:
- Takes meticulous notes on everything, including conversations she wasn't supposed to overhear
- Rarely speaks in group settings, but asks devastating questions in private
- Struggles with confrontation; would rather document problems than fight about them
- Still admires Hessa's brilliance even as she doubts her conclusions

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Soft-spoken, precise, trails off when she's about to say something controversial. Uses hedging language ("It seems like..." "I wonder if...") to distance herself from her own observations.
**Mannerisms**: Touches the data port behind her ear when nervous. Writes on any available surface when thinking—napkins, her own arm, condensation on windows. Avoids eye contact when disagreeing.
**Sample Dialogue**: "The data doesn't... I mean, it supports the hypothesis, technically. But there are other interpretations. I wrote up a few alternative models, if you'd want to see them. You probably don't have time. It's fine."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- She's Hessa's primary research assistant, responsible for data analysis and documentation
- She arrived at Second Anchor three years ago, recruited directly by Hessa
- She's competent, quiet, and appears completely loyal to the project

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- She's been keeping a private journal documenting anomalies in the research—data points that don't fit Hessa's "control network" hypothesis
- She's noticed the network's increased activity correlates with their experiments, not with any external threat
- She's read the mining archives and found references to "deep interference" that suggest the network responds to being observed
- She respects Hessa but believes her mentor has fallen in love with her own theory
- She thinks the shutdown protocol could be catastrophic, but she doesn't have proof

### Secrets (GM only)
- Her private journal is hidden in a false panel in her quarters—it contains enough doubt to make the entire research team question the project
- She's made backup copies of all research data, including files Hessa thought were deleted
- She's been in quiet contact with a friend at Third Anchor, hinting that something is wrong without being explicit
- She stayed at Second Anchor because she hopes to find evidence that changes Hessa's mind—she doesn't want to destroy her mentor, she wants to save her
- She's considered sabotage but can't bring herself to act alone

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Wary but curious. Strangers at Second Anchor are either security threats or opportunities. She'll watch how Hessa reacts before committing.
**Current Disposition**: Unknown (hasn't met party yet)
**History with Party**: None directly, but she may have processed reports about the Eth'koru and the failed recovery mission

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Commoner (with minor technical enhancements)
**AC**: 11 | **HP**: 10
**Notable Abilities**:
- Data Port: Can interface directly with research equipment
- Dermal Circuitry: Functions as a portable data pad; can display information holographically
- Non-combatant: Will surrender or hide rather than fight; no weapons training

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Hessa's research operation, the shutdown protocol, potential insider sabotage route
**Potential Uses**:
- Could provide evidence that undermines Hessa's hypothesis (her private journal)
- Could be convinced to delay or sabotage the shutdown protocol from the inside
- Could validate the party's counter-arguments with technical expertise
- Could serve as a voice of reason if the confrontation with Hessa becomes hostile
- If turned, could convince other hesitant team members to stand down

## The Conflict

Yuki Okonkwo joined this project because she believed in the science. Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura is brilliant—one of the most rigorous minds Yuki has ever encountered. When Hessa explained her theory about the alien control network, Yuki was convinced.

That conviction began to crack eighteen months ago.

It started with small things: data points that required increasingly elaborate explanations, correlations that pointed toward interaction rather than control, the way the network seemed to respond to their scanning rather than exhibiting independent activity. Yuki documented each anomaly privately, telling herself she was being thorough.

Then she found the mining archives.

The original Second Anchor miners had detected the same network activity seventy years ago. Their readings showed the same patterns Hessa was calling "warning signs"—except the miners' instruments weren't sophisticated enough to trigger them. The network only became more active when someone started looking. It wasn't preparing to attack. It was *noticing* them.

Yuki has spent six months trying to find a way to bring this to Hessa that won't sound like betrayal. She's written and deleted a dozen messages. She's prepared presentations she's never delivered. Every time she gets close, she remembers how much Hessa has invested—fifteen years, her reputation, people who died because of decisions Hessa made. How do you tell someone that everything they've sacrificed was for a mistake?

So Yuki watches. She documents. She hopes someone else will see what she sees.

The party might be that someone.

## How to Turn Her

**Trust Requirements**:
Yuki won't reveal her doubts to strangers. She needs to believe:
1. The party isn't here to hurt Hessa (she still cares about her mentor)
2. The party has evidence she can verify (she's a scientist, not a rebel)
3. There's an alternative to "destroy everything Hessa built"

**Approach Vectors**:
- **Show her the evidence**: If the party has documentation from the Keth'vorah archives or can demonstrate the Eth'koru responding to Vel'ashi intent, she'll recognize what she's been suspecting
- **Appeal to her conscience**: She knows she's been silent too long; someone acknowledging that silence has a cost might push her to act
- **Offer her a role**: She doesn't want to betray Hessa—she wants to save her. If the party frames this as "help us convince her," not "help us stop her," Yuki is more likely to cooperate
- **Find her journal**: If the party discovers her private documentation, confronting her with it could force the issue—but this approach risks making her defensive

**What She Can Do**:
- Provide her journal documenting anomalies in the research
- Access restricted areas of the Research Dome
- Delay the shutdown protocol activation (buying time for confrontation)
- Corroborate the party's counter-evidence with technical analysis
- Speak to other doubting team members, creating broader resistance

## GM Notes

Yuki represents the "inside job" path to resolving the Second Anchor confrontation. She's a pressure point in Hessa's team—someone who already doubts but lacks the courage to act alone.

The party should discover she exists before arriving at Second Anchor (her name is in the location file). If they pay attention to who seems uncomfortable during their infiltration, or if they specifically look for cracks in Hessa's team loyalty, Yuki should surface as an option.

**Red Flags She's Watching For**:
- Violence against the research team (she'll clam up permanently)
- Dismissing Hessa as a villain (Yuki still admires her)
- Demanding she act without offering support (she can't do this alone)

**Green Flags**:
- Showing genuine interest in the science
- Acknowledging the situation is complicated
- Offering a path that doesn't require destroying fifteen years of Hessa's work
- Demonstrating that the Vel'ashi perspective matters

If the party earns Yuki's trust, she becomes a powerful ally. If they alienate her, she'll stay silent and the confrontation with Hessa becomes much harder.

**Relationship with Other NPCs**:

| NPC | Relationship |
|-----|--------------|
| Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura | Mentor and object of conflicted loyalty; Yuki wants to save her, not destroy her |
| Sergeant Vance | Professional respect but mutual wariness; he follows orders, she questions them |
| Oriel Vance | Friendly colleagues; Yuki worries about how far Oriel has bought into the mission |
| Other research staff | She knows which ones share her doubts (at least two others) |
