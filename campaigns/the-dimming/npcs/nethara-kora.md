## Appearance

A lean Vel'ashi woman with skin that still carries traces of traveling camouflage - mottled grays and browns that never fully faded back to her natural blue-green. Her features are sharp, her eyes (now closed forever) were described by those who knew her as "seeing too much." Deep claw wounds mar her shoulder and side—the unmistakable marks of a glintcat, though she traveled too carefully to have been caught unawares by a wild one.

- Rarely smiled, but when she did it transformed her face
- Kept detailed journals (currently missing)

## GM Notes

Nethara'kora discovered something that challenged everything she believed about her world. In the days before her death, she realized that the "magic" the Vel'ashi take for granted - their shape-shifting, the bioluminescent growths, the subtle technologies everyone uses without understanding - all came from an ancient nanomachine network. And humans at Third Anchor were trying to turn it off.

She took the Eth'koru from a hidden Keth'vorah cache, knowing it would lead her to the network's control points. She was intercepted by mercenaries before she could reach safety. Her journals, dropped somewhere along her flight, contain everything she learned.

Her last act was to pass the mission to strangers because she had no other choice. Whether they were worthy of it remains to be seen.
