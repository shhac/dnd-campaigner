# Ashkaleth'mora

**Role**: Authority/Ally (depending on party choices)
**Location**: Keth'vorah Archives (arrives in Dustmeet later)
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Vel'ashi |
| **Occupation** | Keth'vorah Senior Investigator |
| **Age** | 142 (elder, highly experienced) |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

An elderly Vel'ashi woman whose skin has settled into deep blue-grey with patterns that barely shift anymore - the stillness of age or exceptional control. She moves slowly but deliberately, every gesture economical. Her eyes are pale silver, almost luminous, and miss nothing. She wears the dark formal robes of a senior Keth'vorah member, embroidered with subtle geometric patterns that reference ancient texts.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Patient, observant, neither warm nor cold - simply thorough
**Motivation**: Understand what happened to Nethara'kora; recover the Eth'koru for proper custody; determine whether the strangers can be trusted
**Fear**: That the order's secrecy has made them too slow to respond to genuine threats

**Personality Traits**:
- Treats everyone with the same measured respect, regardless of station
- Asks questions that seem tangential, then reveals she was building a larger picture
- Believes in the order's mission but has quiet doubts about some of its methods

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Measured, precise, with the cadence of someone who chooses words carefully. Uses formal Vel'ashi constructions even in casual conversation. Pauses often, but the pauses feel contemplative rather than uncertain.

**Mannerisms**: Steeples her fingers when listening. Closes her eyes briefly when processing new information. Occasionally quotes ancient texts, then translates for those unfamiliar.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "Nethara'kora was not reckless. If she gave the Eth'koru to strangers rather than return it to proper custody, she had reasons. I would like to understand those reasons."
- "The order values preservation over action. This is... usually wise. I am beginning to wonder if 'usually' is sufficient."
- "You ask if I trust you. That is not the right question. The question is whether what you intend to do serves the same purpose as what I must do. If so, trust is secondary."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- She is a senior Keth'vorah member with authority to investigate and act independently
- She trained Nethara'kora, decades ago
- She is known for thoroughness rather than speed

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- She disagreed with the order's decision to send Nethara'kora alone on this investigation
- She has suspected for years that the order's archives are incomplete - that the founders knew things they did not pass down
- She knows about the energy fluctuations that prompted Nethara'kora's mission but not their source

### Secrets (GM only)
- She has read restricted texts that hint at the nanomachine network's true nature, though she does not fully understand what she read
- She suspects Nethara'kora was deliberately silenced - that the attack was not random
- She is more willing to work with outsiders than most order members because she believes the order's insularity has become a liability
- If the party proves trustworthy, she will share resources the order would not normally provide to non-members

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Professional assessment. Are they capable? Are they trustworthy? Did Nethara'kora choose them for a reason, or was it desperation?

**Current Disposition**: Reserved judgment pending observation

**History with Party**: None directly, but she has read reports about them (from Koresh'rath, from order contacts in Dustmeet)

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Mage (modified - fewer combat spells, more utility)
**AC**: 12 | **HP**: 28
**Notable Abilities**:
- Detect Magic (at will)
- Identify (ritual, no components needed - her expertise)
- Counterspell (ancient technique, limited uses)
- Shield (defensive only)

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: The Keth'vorah, Nethara'kora's backstory, Korimeth's order connection

**Potential Uses**:
- Can provide official authorization for the party's mission (if convinced)
- Can share historical context about the Eth'koru and "the Dimming"
- Can connect the party to Keth'vorah resources (caches, contacts, ancient sites)
- Represents a choice: work with the order or continue independently
- May become a more active ally later in the campaign if the party earns trust

## Relationship with Korimeth

Ashkaleth'mora knows of Korimeth - she reviewed her initiate file when Nethara'kora took her as a student. She sees potential in Korimeth's analytical approach, though she also notes the younger Vel'ashi's growing questions about the order.

If they meet, Ashkaleth'mora will:
- Acknowledge Korimeth's loss of her mentor with formal respect
- Not order Korimeth to return the Eth'koru - she's interested in seeing what happens
- Offer information Korimeth wouldn't normally have access to, as a test of what she does with it
- Quietly evaluate whether Korimeth should be promoted, expelled, or simply watched

## GM Notes

Ashkaleth'mora represents the Keth'vorah's better nature - thorough, principled, genuinely dedicated to protecting Keth'toh. She's also a test of whether the party can work within systems rather than against them.

### Timing
She arrives 2-4 sessions after the opening, depending on pacing. The party should have time to investigate independently first.

### Negotiations
She wants:
1. To understand what happened to Nethara'kora
2. To assess the threat Nethara'kora was investigating
3. To determine whether the Eth'koru is safe with these strangers

She offers:
1. Historical context the party lacks
2. Access to Keth'vorah resources (caches, contacts)
3. A degree of official sanction for their mission
4. Answers to Korimeth's questions about her status

### If the Party Refuses Cooperation
She doesn't force the issue. The order is not an army; she has no authority to compel strangers. But she will follow at a distance, gathering her own information. She may become an obstacle if the party seems to be mishandling the situation.

### The Deeper Truth
Ashkaleth'mora has read enough restricted texts to sense that "magic" has a mechanism, that the Collapse destroyed something specific, that the Vel'ashi were once different. She cannot articulate these suspicions clearly - the knowledge is fragmentary - but she is more prepared than most to accept uncomfortable truths if the party discovers them.
