# Story State: The Dimming

> **Last Updated**: Session 0 (Campaign Start)
> **Last Session**: Pre-session
>
> Note: Session numbers are sequential starting from 1

## Current Situation

**Location**: Dustmeet, the common room of the Layered Rest (a local inn/trading house)
**Time**: Late afternoon, the amber hour before the bioluminescent growths activate
**Immediate Context**: Nethara'kora has just died in the party's presence, pressing the Eth'koru into their hands. The common room has fallen silent. Other patrons are watching. The local constable will arrive soon.

## Active Quests

### Primary Quest: The Investigator's Charge
- **Objective**: Follow the Eth'koru's guidance and stop "the Dimming" - whatever that means
- **Given By**: Nethara'kora (deceased Keth'vorah investigator)
- **Known Information**: Almost nothing. She spoke of darkness, of something that would end what the Vel'ashi have become. The artifact pulses and points.
- **Current Progress**: Quest just received. No leads beyond the artifact itself.

### Secondary Quests
- [ ] Learn what happened to Nethara'kora - she arrived wounded and fevered
- [ ] Contact the Keth'vorah to report the investigator's death

## Recent Events Summary

The campaign begins in medias res. Nethara'kora stumbled into the Layered Rest, the main trading house in Dustmeet, clearly injured and running from something. She collapsed near the party's table - whether the party knew her or were simply nearby is to be established. With her dying breaths, she passed them the Eth'koru and charged them with stopping "the Dimming."

The artifact is warm to the touch and pulses with inner light. Even now, a needle-like beam within it points steadily toward the west - toward the abandoned Second Anchor.

## Unresolved Threads

- What wounded Nethara'kora?
- What is "the Dimming" she feared?
- Why does the Eth'koru point toward human territory?
- How will the Keth'vorah respond to losing one of their own?

## GM Notes (Secret)

### Hidden Information
- Nethara'kora was attacked by human mercenaries hired by Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura's team to recover the Eth'koru; they used a trained glintcat to track and wound her
- The Eth'koru awakened weeks ago when the Second Anchor researchers ran their first full-scale scan of the nanomachine network
- The artifact is itself a piece of the original system - a diagnostic and navigation tool
- "The Dimming" is what the ancient Vel'ashi called a network shutdown. It's in their oldest myths, but no one alive knows what it really means.

### Upcoming Planned Events
- Constable Koresh'rath will arrive to investigate the death
- The Keth'vorah will send an envoy within days once they learn of Nethara'kora's fate
- If the party delays too long, the mercenaries who attacked Nethara'kora may come looking for the artifact

### Consequences Pending
- Possessing a Keth'vorah artifact will draw attention - both helpful and dangerous
- The research team at Second Anchor knows the artifact exists and wants it
- Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura's experiments continue regardless of whether the party acts
