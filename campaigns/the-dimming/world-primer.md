# World Primer: Keth'toh

What any inhabitant of Keth'toh would know.

---

## The World

Keth'toh is what the natives call this world. Humans designate it Chalawan-II. It is a place where ancient mysteries hide beneath everyday life — ruins dot the landscape, artifacts surface unexpectedly, and the land itself sometimes behaves in ways no one can fully explain.

## The Vel'ashi

The native people of Keth'toh. Shorter than humans (about 5 feet on average), slender, with blue-grey to violet skin that can shift color — camouflage in the wild, subtle expression shifts in conversation. Their eyes are large with horizontal pupils, ranging from amber to silver. They live roughly 170-190 years.

The shifting unsettles most humans who haven't grown used to it. Vel'ashi call humans **Sky'ashi** ("sky-people"). They organize into extended family groups, govern by consensus, and maintain strong oral traditions. Most treat ancient artifacts with superstitious reverence — "magic" is simply part of the world, like weather.

## Humans

Colonists who arrived roughly 200 years ago. Over generations, three variants have emerged:

- **Photosynthetic ("Greens/Suncatchers")**: Greenish skin tones, can supplement nutrition from sunlight, but suffer in prolonged darkness.
- **Dark-Adapted ("Shades/Deepfolk")**: Pale skin, silver or white hair, superior darkvision and hearing, but bright light causes them pain.
- **Cybernetic ("Wired/Chipped")**: Visible technological implants — data ports, ocular augments, dermal circuitry. Require periodic maintenance.

Baseline (unchanged) humans still exist but grow rarer with each generation.

## The Collapse

A catastrophe that destroyed the ancient civilization of Keth'toh, thousands of years before humans arrived. Nobody remembers what happened. The ruins it left behind are scattered everywhere — strange architecture, indecipherable symbols, and occasional artifacts that still function. The Vel'ashi changed dramatically after the Collapse, becoming smaller and gaining their shifting abilities.

## The Three Anchors

Human settlements on Keth'toh:

- **First Anchor**: The original landing site. Smaller, ceremonial, tradition-focused.
- **Second Anchor**: An abandoned mining settlement, evacuated 70 years ago under mysterious circumstances. Few visit.
- **Third Anchor**: The largest settlement and center of human governance.

## The Keth'vorah

An ancient Vel'ashi scholarly order that preserves what remains of pre-Collapse knowledge. They study relics, maintain restricted archives, and control access to dangerous artifacts. Respected but secretive — most Vel'ashi know of them but have never interacted with one.

## Common Creatures

- **Glintcats**: Six-legged felines with metallic, color-shifting fur. Clever ambush predators. Respected in folk tales as tricksters.
- **Trillwings**: Small four-winged birds with color-shifting feathers. Their dawn chorus is considered a blessing. A flock going silent means danger.
- **Shimmerbeasts**: Six-legged herd animals with camouflage skin. Primary protein source for Vel'ashi. Entire herds can "vanish" against terrain.
- **Razorwings**: Flying predators with sharp-edged wings. Hunt in flocks. Territorial and dangerous.
- **Dustrunners**: Small, fast rodent-like creatures. Good luck if one crosses your path left-to-right.

## Dustmeet

A native-run trading post at the crossroads of three ancient paths, half a day south of Third Anchor. Neutral ground where Vel'ashi and humans trade. The architecture shifts subtly — walls change shape, colors follow the light. The Dustmeet Council governs, wanting peace and profitable trade above all.

## Distances and Travel

- **Dustmeet to Third Anchor**: Half a day's travel north along a well-trafficked road
- **Dustmeet to First Anchor**: Two days east through settled Vel'ashi lowlands
- **Dustmeet to Second Anchor**: Four to five days west on foot, through the Shimmerwood and over the highland Pale Reach
- **The Shimmerwood**: Dense forest west of Dustmeet with light-refracting bark that disorients travelers. Half a day to enter from Dustmeet; the trail passes through it for roughly two days
- **The Pale Reach**: Highland wilderness between the Shimmerwood and the western canyons. Exposed, windy, with razorwing territory. Another two to three days beyond the forest
- **Second Anchor**: Lies in a mineral-rich canyon system at the far end of the Pale Reach

Travel assumes on foot at a normal pace. Mounted travel (on shimmerbeasts, if available) roughly halves the time.
