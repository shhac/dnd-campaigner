**Race**: Human (Photosynthetic Variant)
**Build**: Tall, broad-shouldered, military bearing. Moves with trained economy — no wasted motion.
**Distinctive features**: Faint greenish skin undertone that deepens with sun exposure (chlorophyll). Weathered face, hard eyes. Not obvious in dim light.
**Speech**: Direct, economical, military cadence. Few words when one will do. Dry humor in tense moments. Clipped with humans, measured and respectful with Vel'ashi.
