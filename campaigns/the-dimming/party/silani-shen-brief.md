# Silani'shen — Appearance Brief

**Race**: Vel'ashi
**Build**: Shorter than humans (~5 ft), slender, graceful. Leans forward when engaged in conversation.
**Distinctive features**: Blue-grey to violet skin with involuntary emotional color shifts (experienced observers can read her mood). Large eyes with horizontal pupils. Subtle Vel'ashi accent — slightly elongated vowels, careful enunciation.
**Speech**: Warm, curious, conversational. Asks questions constantly with genuine interest. Uses human idioms frequently and incorrectly with complete confidence: "Let us cross that river when we burn it." Phrases: "Tell me more about that," "As the humans say..."
**Mannerisms**: Skin shifts involuntarily toward muted blending colors when threatened. Checks a small mirror for her own color-shifts. Always has her journal nearby, collecting human sayings and diplomatic notes.
**Signature equipment**: Light leather armor (Vel'ashi make, shifts color subtly with her), diplomat's blade with the 'shen family crest, shoulder satchel, diplomatic credentials in a protective case, quality but practical traveler's clothes in muted colors.
