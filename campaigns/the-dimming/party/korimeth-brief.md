# Korimeth — Appearance Brief

**Race**: Vel'ashi
**Build**: Shorter than humans (~5 ft), slender. Still and watchful — moves with deliberate precision.
**Distinctive features**: Blue-grey to violet skin with controlled, subtle shifts. Large eyes with horizontal pupils (amber range). Exceptionally controlled color responses — strong emotions sometimes break through. No family suffix (marks her as incomplete in the Keth'vorah).
**Speech**: Measured, precise, slightly formal. Academic vocabulary. Qualifies statements extensively: "based on available evidence," "hypothesis." Dry humor often missed. Long pauses while formulating responses. Occasional ancient Keth'ashi terms.
**Mannerisms**: Takes notes constantly — journal always at hand. Pauses before answering. Examines objects with a small brass hand-lens. Analytical distance reads as cold.
**Signature equipment**: Dark blue studded leather with silver clasps (Keth'vorah issue), light crossbow, component pouch, leather-bound Journal of Observations, brass hand-lens.
