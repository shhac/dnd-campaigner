# Thaneshi — Appearance Brief

**Race**: Vel'ashi
**Build**: Shorter than humans (~5 ft), wiry and weathered from decades of wilderness living. Crouches rather than sits.
**Distinctive features**: Blue-grey skin that shifts instinctively toward muted earth tones and bark textures. Large eyes with horizontal pupils. Late middle years — old enough for deep forest experience, young enough for many decades remaining. Goes absolutely still when threatened.
**Speech**: Sparse, observational, full of nature metaphors. Long pauses mid-sentence. Bursts of unexpected warmth. Slightly archaic vocabulary. Reports animal "conversations" with complete sincerity. Tongue-clicks (mimics trillwing warning calls) when thinking.
**Mannerisms**: Sniffs the air constantly. Positions near exits or back-to-wall. Makes soft animal sounds as unconscious commentary. Touches surfaces as he passes. Squints at bright artificial light. Checks wind direction. Sleeps in trees even when beds are available.
**Signature equipment**: Handmade leather armor (patched and re-patched, various hides), hunting bow with smooth-worn handle, skinning knife (blade honed thin from decades of sharpening), layered practical garments in forest colors with many pockets.
