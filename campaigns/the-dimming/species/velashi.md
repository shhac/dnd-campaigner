# The Vel'ashi

## Overview

The Vel'ashi are the native sapient species of Keth'toh. They are slightly shorter than humans on average (4'8" to 5'6"), with a lithe build and the unsettling ability to subtly shift their appearance. Their skin tones range from deep blue-grey to pale violet, often with patterns that can fade or intensify with mood or intent.

## Pre-Collapse: The Keth'ashi

**Ancient Name**: Keth'ashi (forgotten by all but the most learned Keth'vorah scholars)

Before the Collapse, the Vel'ashi were known as the Keth'ashi. Ancient imagery depicts them as:
- Noticeably more muscular and robust
- Larger craniums (roughly 15% bigger than modern Vel'ashi)
- Standing eye-to-eye with humans or slightly taller
- No evidence of the shape-shifting ability

The Vel'ashi do not recognize these ancient depictions as their ancestors. Most assume the images represent a different species, gods, or stylized ideals. The Keth'vorah maintains records suggesting the truth but keeps this knowledge restricted.

## Post-Collapse Evolution

The catastrophe that destroyed Keth'ashi civilization created intense survival pressure. Over millennia, the species adapted:

**Lost Traits**:
- Muscular bulk (metabolically expensive)
- Larger brain case (cognitive differences unclear)
- Height and physical presence

**Gained Traits**:
- **Chromatic Shifting**: Skin can change hue and pattern to blend with surroundings
- **Silhouette Softening**: Body outline can become indistinct, making them harder to track
- **Facial Plasticity**: Features can subtly rearrange, useful for expressing emotions across species or mild disguise

These adaptations suggest intense predation pressure in the post-Collapse era—the Vel'ashi became more prey-like to survive. The nanomachine network likely facilitated this rapid evolution.

## Physical Characteristics

### Appearance
- **Height**: 4'8" to 5'6" (average 5'1")
- **Build**: Slender, with elongated limbs relative to torso
- **Skin**: Blue-grey to violet, with subtle bioluminescent undertones
- **Eyes**: Large, with horizontal pupils; colors range from amber to silver
- **Hair**: Fine, often translucent or iridescent; some have none
- **Hands**: Four fingers plus opposable thumb; slightly longer than human proportions

### Shape-Shifting Limits
The shifting ability is **cosmetic only**:
- Cannot change mass, height, or skeletal structure
- Cannot mimic specific individuals convincingly
- Works best for camouflage against natural backgrounds
- Requires concentration; stressed Vel'ashi may "flicker"
- Humans find the shifting deeply unsettling—an "uncanny valley" effect

### Lifespan
- Maturity: ~16 years
- Average lifespan: 168-190 years
- Elders (rare): Up to 231 years

*Note: The Lost Colony humans arrived approximately 400 years ago—outside living memory for even the oldest Vel'ashi. The current human settlers arrived 200 years ago; a handful of the most ancient elders may have childhood memories of first contact.*

## Culture

### Social Structure
- Extended family groups (10-30 individuals) form the basic unit
- Multiple family groups form communities with shared governance
- Consensus-based decision making; elders advise but don't rule
- Strong oral traditions preserve history (often inaccurately post-Collapse)

### Relationship with Technology
- Most Vel'ashi treat ancient artifacts with superstitious reverence
- "Magic" is accepted as natural—like weather or gravity
- The Keth'vorah hoards functional technology, studying it in secret
- Average Vel'ashi knows artifacts exist but has never seen one function

### Views on Humans
- Children: Fascinated, will stare openly
- Adults: Wary but not hostile; humans are unpredictable
- Slang term for humans: **Sky'ashi** ("sky-people")—references their extraterrestrial origin
- Intermarriage: Biologically impossible, but cultural adoption occurs rarely

## Names

Vel'ashi names typically follow patterns:
- **Given name**: Often nature-inspired or ancestral
- **Family suffix**: Indicates lineage (e.g., 'veth, 'kora, 'tani)
- **Examples**: Sethaya'veth, Korrin'tani, Veleth'kora

Some Vel'ashi who interact frequently with humans adopt shortened "trade names" that are easier for human tongues.

## Gameplay Notes

### Mechanical Considerations
- **Camouflage**: Advantage on Stealth checks in natural environments when not moving
- **Unsettling Presence**: Disadvantage on Persuasion with humans unfamiliar with Vel'ashi (first meeting only)
- **Darkvision**: 60 feet (evolved for post-Collapse survival)
- **Shifting Concentration**: Shape-shifting requires concentration; damage or stress may cause involuntary flickering

### Roleplaying Hooks
- The disconnect between ancient imagery and modern self-image
- Navigating human distrust of shifting appearances
- Oral traditions that may preserve truth in distorted forms
- The question of what the Vel'ashi lost—and whether they'd want it back
