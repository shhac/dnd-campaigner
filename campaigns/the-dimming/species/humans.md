# Humans of Keth'toh

## Overview

The current human population arrived on Keth'toh approximately 200 years ago as colonists from off-world. Their original vessel and most records of their origin have been lost, but they brought with them technology far more advanced than anything the post-Collapse Vel'ashi possessed—though still primitive compared to the ancient Keth'ashi civilization.

Over generations of living on Keth'toh, humans have diverged into three distinct variants. All still consider themselves fully human, and interbreeding between variants produces viable offspring (usually inheriting traits from one parent or the other, rarely a blend).

## The Lost Colony

Both humans and Vel'ashi share stories of a *previous* human presence on Keth'toh—a colony that arrived approximately 500 years ago, after the Collapse but three centuries before the current human settlers. This "Lost Colony" vanished approximately 400 years ago without clear explanation, leaving a century-long gap before the current settlers arrived.

Their ruins dot remote regions of Keth'toh, built in a style distinct from both Keth'ashi architecture and current human construction—strange angles, materials that resist weathering, symbols that neither species can decipher. The ruins are scattered across the continent, with no clear pattern to their placement.

The truth of the Lost Colony remains one of Keth'toh's great mysteries. Some theorize plague, others war with the Vel'ashi (though no Vel'ashi records support this), and still others believe they simply left—or were taken. The current human settlers have found no bodies, no graves, no evidence of what happened. Just empty buildings and the lingering question.

## Human Variants

### Baseline Humans
Some humans have remained relatively unchanged, particularly those living in climate-controlled settlements with minimal exposure to Keth'toh's environment. They are increasingly rare as generations pass.

### Photosynthetic Variant ("Greens" / "Suncatchers")

**Origin**: Adaptation to Keth'toh's intense solar radiation and nutrient-poor soil.

**Physical Characteristics**:
- Skin has a greenish or teal undertone (chlorophyll-analogue in dermal layer)
- Hair often has greenish or golden highlights
- Eyes tend toward amber or gold
- Slightly lighter build (reduced caloric needs)

**Biological Traits**:
- Can supplement nutrition through photosynthesis (4-6 hours of strong light = one meal equivalent)
- Still require water and some food, but far less than baseline
- **Vulnerability**: Prolonged darkness (more than 48 hours) causes lethargy, depression, and eventually starvation
- Skin may visibly darken or "bloom" when photosynthesizing

**Cultural Notes**:
- Often work as scouts, messengers, or in roles requiring extended travel
- Architecture in their communities maximizes light exposure
- Consider indoor work uncomfortable; may seem restless in enclosed spaces
- Some cultivate small gardens on their skin (symbiotic algae patterns)

**Gameplay**:
- Reduced need for rations in lit environments
- Disadvantage on Constitution saves in prolonged darkness
- May glow faintly when well-fed (disadvantage on Stealth at night after sunny day)

### Dark-Adapted Variant ("Shades" / "Deepfolk")

**Origin**: Adaptation to Keth'toh's extensive cave systems and underground environments.

**Physical Characteristics**:
- Extremely pale skin, often with slight blue or grey undertone
- Hair typically white, silver, or very pale blonde
- Eyes are large with reflective tapetum (eyeshine like nocturnal animals); colors range from silver to pale violet
- Ears slightly larger and more mobile

**Biological Traits**:
- **Superior Darkvision**: Can see in near-total darkness (120 feet)
- **Enhanced Hearing**: Can detect sounds outside normal human range
- **Echolocation**: Some develop basic echolocation (clicking sounds)
- **Vulnerability**: Bright light causes pain and temporary blindness; prolonged exposure can cause permanent damage

**Cultural Notes**:
- Most live underground or in heavily shaded structures
- Nocturnal schedule preferred; may work night shifts in mixed settlements
- Developed sophisticated sound-based art and communication
- Often serve as miners, underground explorers, or night watch

**Gameplay**:
- Darkvision 120 feet
- Advantage on Perception checks involving hearing
- Disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks in bright light
- Sunglasses or goggles are essential equipment

### Cybernetically Integrated Variant ("Wired" / "Chipped")

**Origin**: Descendants of colonists who embraced technological augmentation; maintained through a tradition of implantation.

**Physical Characteristics**:
- Visible technological elements: data ports, ocular implants, dermal circuitry
- Appearance varies wildly based on implant choices
- Often have subtle asymmetries from augmentation
- Some have glowing elements (status indicators, aesthetic choices)

**Biological Traits**:
- **Integrated Tools**: May have built-in devices (communicators, sensors, data storage, weapons)
- **Enhanced Capabilities**: Depending on implants—strength, speed, perception, processing
- **Dependency**: Require maintenance; implants can malfunction or degrade
- **Vulnerability**: Electromagnetic interference can cause disorientation or system failure

**Cultural Notes**:
- Strong engineering tradition; implants are crafted and passed down
- "Going clean" (removing implants) is considered shameful
- Status often tied to sophistication of augmentation
- The most integrated may struggle to relate to "naturals"

**Implant Examples**:
- **Ocular Suite**: Zoom, low-light, recording capability
- **Dermal Armor**: Subdermal plating (reduces flexibility)
- **Neural Link**: Faster processing, perfect memory (headaches common)
- **Tool Hand**: Fingers contain miniature tools, lockpicks, etc.
- **Vocal Modulator**: Voice amplification, translation assistance

**Gameplay**:
- Choose 1-2 implants at character creation (with GM approval)
- Implants provide specific benefits with corresponding drawbacks
- Require periodic maintenance (failure = malfunction table)
- Vulnerable to EMP-like effects (rare but devastating)

## Human Settlements

Humans maintain a handful of permanent settlements on Keth'toh:

- **First Anchor**: The original landing site and ceremonial hub for humanity on Keth'toh. Slightly smaller than Third Anchor, First Anchor remains populated and functioning. It holds deep cultural significance as the place where humanity first touched this world, and important ceremonies—births, deaths, major political decisions—are often conducted here. The settlement has a more traditional character than Third Anchor, with less focus on research and more on preserving human heritage.

- **Second Anchor**: A mining settlement that was abandoned approximately 70 years ago. The official reason varies depending on who you ask—"played out veins," say the administrators; "contaminated water table," say the engineers. But those who lived there before the evacuation sometimes speak differently, in lowered voices, about equipment that malfunctioned in strange patterns, about miners who went too deep and came back *changed*, about the day the foreman sealed Shaft Seven and wouldn't say why. The settlement still stands, its buildings slowly being reclaimed by native growth. Few visit. Fewer stay the night.

- **Third Anchor**: The largest and most prosperous human settlement; the center of human governance on Keth'toh.

- Various smaller outposts, trading posts, and research stations scattered across the regions humans are permitted to inhabit.

## Relations with Vel'ashi

### Human Perspective
- Official policy: Respect native sovereignty, avoid cultural contamination
- Reality: Curiosity, occasional condescension, some genuine respect
- "Gone native": Derogatory term for humans who live among Vel'ashi
- Trade: Humans offer information and crafts; never technology directly

### Vel'ashi Perspective
- Humans are "Sky'ashi"—visitors from beyond
- Generally tolerated but kept at arm's length
- Human technology is viewed as crude but effective
- Some admire human directness; others find it exhausting

## Names

Human names reflect diverse Earth origins, often with colonial-era drift:
- **Examples**: Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura, Marcus Chen-Okafor, Lydia Vance, Evran Volkov-Andersen
- Some adopt Vel'ashi-style naming when living among natives (controversial)

## Gameplay Notes

### Variant Selection
Players choosing a human character should select:
1. **Baseline** (no special traits, no vulnerabilities)
2. **Photosynthetic** (reduced food needs, light dependency)
3. **Dark-Adapted** (superior darkvision/hearing, light sensitivity)
4. **Cybernetic** (custom implants, maintenance required)

### Roleplaying Hooks
- The mystery of the Lost Colony—are there descendants still out there?
- What really happened at Second Anchor?
- Navigating the "don't share technology" cultural rule
- Variant tensions (Greens and Shades have difficulty cohabiting)
- The question of what "human" means after 200 years of divergence
