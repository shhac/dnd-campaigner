# Vel'ashi Naming Guide

A comprehensive reference for creating Vel'ashi names that feel authentic to The Dimming's setting.

## Linguistic Foundations

Vel'ashi names derive from the ancient Keth'ashi language, though much has been lost or corrupted over millennia. The characteristic apostrophe separates syllabic units and often marks where sounds have merged or been simplified from the original tongue.

### Sound Principles

**Favored Consonants**: v, k, th, s, r, l, n, m, sh
**Favored Vowels**: e, a, i, o (soft, flowing)
**Avoided**: Hard stops at word endings (p, b, d), harsh clusters (str, kr, pr)
**Rhythm**: Names flow—typically 2-4 syllables with soft transitions

## Naming Conventions

### Birth Names
A child receives their given name within the first month, chosen by the mother after consultation with elders. The family suffix is automatic through the maternal line.

### Name Gender
Vel'ashi names are not strongly gendered. Most names can be given to any child, though some families maintain loose traditions (names ending in -i or -a slightly more common for females, -ek or -ath for males). This is descriptive, not prescriptive.

### Trade Names
Vel'ashi who interact frequently with humans often adopt simplified "trade names" that are easier for human tongues. These may be:
- Shortened versions (Nethara becomes "Netha" or "Thara")
- Translated concepts (Koraleth might become "Old Tree")
- Completely invented human-style names ("Mira," "Kel")

**Examples**:
| Full Name | Trade Name |
|-----------|------------|
| Korathi'veth | Kora |
| Veleth'tani | Vel |
| Morvethri | Veth |
| Ashkol'rath | Ash |
| Thorissi'than | Thori |

### Regional Variations

**Southern Lowlands**: Names tend toward softer sounds, longer forms
**Northern Mountains**: Sharper consonants, shorter names
**Coastal Communities**: Water-inspired names, 'rin suffix common
**Cave Dwellers**: Earth names, 'mori and 'kel suffixes
**Trading Posts**: More trade names, mixed heritage

### Earned Names
Some Vel'ashi earn epithets through their deeds, which may replace or supplement their family suffix:
- Korath'stonehand (famous builder)
- Veleth'farwalker (legendary explorer)
- Nethara'truthseeker (Keth'vorah investigator)

## Names to Avoid

### Too Earth-Like
These sound like common Earth names and break immersion:
- Elara, Kira, Zara (too Mediterranean)
- Luna, Stella, Aurora (too Latin)
- Willow, River, Stone (too English)
- Any name from popular Earth media

### Too Generic Fantasy
These sound like every other fantasy setting:
- Anything with -iel or -wen endings (too Tolkien)
- Names starting with Ae- or ending in -dor
- Galadriel/Legolas adjacent sounds
- Dragon Age, Elder Scrolls, etc. character names

### Accidentally Human
Watch for names that sound like human names with apostrophes added:
- Don't just insert apostrophes into "Kevin" or "Sarah"
- Avoid anything that sounds like a common Earth name when spoken aloud

## Quick Generation Method

1. **Pick a category** that fits the character (flowing, stone, light, nature, sharp)
2. **Select or blend** syllables from that category
3. **Add a family suffix** that fits their background
4. **Check** it doesn't sound too Earth-like or duplicate existing names
5. **Create a trade name** if they interact with humans

### Syllable Components for Building Names

**Opening Syllables**: Ve-, Ko-, Eth-, Mel-, Ash-, Ther-, Sel-, Neth-, Sil-, Mor-, Kel-, Vor-

**Middle Syllables**: -eth-, -ori-, -ani-, -ath-, -ish-, -eni-, -oth-, -ara-, -eli-

**Closing Syllables**: -th, -ri, -ni, -an, -esh, -or, -el, -in, -a, -ath

**Example Construction**:
- Ve + ori + n = Veorin
- Kel + eth + a = Keletha
- Ash + ani + 'mora = Ashani'mora
