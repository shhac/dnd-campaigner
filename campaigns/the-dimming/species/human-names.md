# Human Names of Keth'toh

A comprehensive reference for creating human names that reflect colony ship cultural blending and 200 years of variant divergence.

## The Naming Philosophy

### The Colony Ship Era

The original colonists spent four generations in transit. By the time they reached Keth'toh, the strict cultural boundaries of Earth had dissolved into something new. A child born to a Nigerian-Swedish couple might have a Japanese godparent and grow up speaking a pidgin of six languages. Names became untethered from their original cultures.

**What happened during transit:**
- Given names drifted toward whatever sounded pleasant, regardless of origin
- Surnames increasingly reflected profession or ship-section more than heritage
- Compound surnames emerged from unions but also from close friendships and adoptive relationships
- Pronunciation shifted as multiple accents merged into "ship-standard"
- Meaning was forgotten; names became purely aesthetic

### The Landing and Divergence

When the colonists arrived on Keth'toh, they already had a homogenized naming culture. Over 200 years, this re-diverged as variants developed distinct identities:

- **Baseline** communities preserved the most "ship-standard" naming, treating it as heritage
- **Photosynthetic** communities drifted toward softer phonemes, flowing structures
- **Dark-adapted** communities favored crisp consonants and shorter forms (easier to locate by sound)
- **Cybernetic** lineages developed technical naming conventions, including generation markers

### Drift Patterns to Apply

When generating names, consider these real linguistic shifts:

| Original Sound | Drifted Form | Example |
|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Complex clusters | Simplified | Mikhail -> Mikal, Bjorn -> Byorn |
| Aspirated stops | Softened | Takeshi -> Takesi, Katherine -> Katerin |
| Tonal elements | Lost | Xiaoming -> Shaoming (flat) |
| Silent letters | Dropped or voiced | Siobhan -> Shovan |
| Long names | Truncated | Oluwaseun -> Seun, Ekaterina -> Ekat |

## Variant-Specific Naming Aesthetics

### Baseline Humans

**Philosophy:** Preservation as identity. Baseline communities see themselves as keepers of human heritage.

**Characteristics:**
- Most likely to use "traditional" two-part names (given + surname)
- Surnames often preserved from ship records with original spelling
- Given names may be deliberately archaic, pulled from preserved databases
- Resist Keth'toh-coined elements

**Sound profile:** Varied, whatever feels "classically human"

**Example names:**
- Edris Vasquez
- Miruna Petrov
- Tobias Holloway
- Adaora Chen-Okafor

### Photosynthetic ("Greens" / "Suncatchers")

**Philosophy:** Flowing names that feel warm and open, like sunlight.

**Characteristics:**
- Favor vowel-heavy names with liquid consonants (l, r, m, n)
- Avoid harsh stops (k, t, p) at the start of names
- May incorporate botanical or light-related middle names
- Sol- prefix is an honorific, not part of the given name
- Surnames often occupational (Lightward, Greenbloom) or compound

**Sound profile:** Melodic, warm, rising intonation patterns

**Given name preferences:**
- Masculine: Alaric, Eamon, Lucien, Oriel, Ronan, Ilias, Lior
- Feminine: Amara, Elira, Ianthe, Lumina, Mirela, Sarina, Yolande
- Neutral: Aubrin, Elin, Leander, Solenne, Vaelin

**Example full names:**
- Eamon Lightward
- Mirela Reyes-Nakamura
- Solenne Greenbloom-Andersen

### Dark-Adapted ("Shades" / "Deepfolk")

**Philosophy:** Names that work in the dark - short, distinct, easy to echo-locate.

**Characteristics:**
- Prefer monosyllabic or disyllabic given names
- Favor hard consonants that click well in echolocation
- Avoid names that sound too similar to common environmental echoes
- May use "echo-names" - surnames chosen for how they sound when spoken in a cavern
- Doubled consonants are common (help with auditory distinction)

**Sound profile:** Crisp, percussive, clear edges

**Given name preferences:**
- Masculine: Ash, Brek, Colm, Dak, Ivo, Kell, Nacht, Torv, Unn, Vess
- Feminine: Brenna, Cass, Detta, Eira, Liv, Mott, Nix, Ula, Wynn
- Neutral: Beck, Denn, Fen, Joss, Nox, Penn, Senn, Vex

**Example full names:**
- Colm Deepwell
- Nix Volkov-Silentfoot
- Torv Lastlight

### Cybernetic ("Wired" / "Chipped")

**Philosophy:** Names are identifiers. Precision matters.

**Characteristics:**
- Strong tradition of naming children after lineage founders
- Generation markers are common (surname-N, indicating Nth generation of implant line)
- Compound surnames preserve technical/engineering heritage
- May adopt "callsigns" that eventually become legal names
- Given names often have a technical or precise feel - clear syllables, no ambiguity

**Sound profile:** Sharp, precise, unambiguous when transmitted

**Given name preferences:**
- Masculine: Aldric, Declan, Gerritt, Hadren, Kelvan, Moric, Prinn, Tessler, Vance
- Feminine: Adria, Calista, Greta, Hessa, Linnea, Marit, Signe, Tova
- Neutral: Corvin, Jesper, Kaedin, Mira, Renn, Sev, Taran

**Common generation lineages:**
- Muller line (engineering)
- Nakamura line (optics)
- Kowalski line (structural augmentation)
- Volkov line (security systems)

**Example full names:**
- Gerritt Muller-7 (seventh generation Muller implant lineage)
- Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura
- Sev Kowalski-3
- Mira Tessler-Vance

## Names Currently in Use

Track these to avoid duplication:

**PCs:**
- Eamon Lightward (PC, Photosynthetic soldier)

**NPCs:**
- Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura (lead researcher/antagonist, Cybernetic)
- Evran Volkov-Andersen (governor of Third Anchor, Baseline)

- Dust-Walker Cael (Fringe guide at Third Anchor)
- Oriel Vance (Eamon's missing friend, works at Second Anchor research facility)

---

## Names to Avoid

### Too Contemporary Earth
Names that sound like someone's coworker, not a colonist 200 years removed:

- Ashley, Brandon, Brittany, Jason, Jennifer, Kevin, Madison, Tyler
- Any name currently in Earth's top 100 baby names
- Celebrity names (no Beyonces, Elons, Taylors)
- Names from recognizable current media

### Too Obviously AI-Generated
Names that feel like they came from a fantasy name generator:

- Ava, Kai, Zara, Luna (overused "cool" names)
- Anything with apostrophes (save for Vel'ashi)
- Names that are just rearranged syllables (Lyren, Kaelith, Xandros)
- Names ending in -ia/-ius/-ael for no linguistic reason
- Compound word names (Starlight, Moonwhisper) for non-occupational surnames

### Too Single-Culture
Names that haven't "drifted" enough:

- Pure Japanese: Takeshi, Yuki, Haruki (use simplified forms: Tak, Yuki-blends)
- Pure Irish: Siobhan, Padraig (use phonetic spellings: Shovan, Padra)
- Pure Chinese: Xiaoming, Zhenwei (use drift forms: Shaoming, Zhen)
- Pure Arabic: Muhammad, Abdullah (use shortened forms: Muda, Abdal)

### Accidentally Vel'ashi
Watch for names that sound like they belong to the native species:

- Names with apostrophes
- Names ending in -eth, -ori, -ashi
- Three-syllable names heavy on v-k-th sounds
- Names that could be honorific + root in Vel'ashi pattern

---

## Quick Generation Method

1. **Determine variant** (Baseline, Photosynthetic, Dark-adapted, Cybernetic)
2. **Apply sound aesthetic** for that variant
3. **Choose given name** from appropriate list or generate using variant's phonetic preferences
4. **Select surname type** based on character background:
   - Preserved = status-conscious or Baseline
   - Compound = mixed heritage or alliance
   - Occupational = identifying with Keth'toh role
   - Coined = "gone native" or Vel'ashi-influenced
5. **Add generation marker** (for Cybernetic only, if appropriate)
6. **Verify** against used names and avoidance lists

### Phoneme Building Blocks

**For Photosynthetic (flowing, warm):**
- Starts: A-, E-, I-, L-, M-, O-, R-, S-, Y-
- Ends: -a, -an, -el, -ia, -ien, -in, -or

**For Dark-adapted (crisp, short):**
- Starts: B-, C-, D-, F-, K-, N-, T-, V-
- Ends: -ck, -ell, -enn, -ix, -ot, -oss, -yn

**For Cybernetic (precise, technical):**
- Starts: Ad-, Cal-, Ger-, Had-, Kel-, Mar-, Sev-, Tes-
- Ends: -an, -ic, -in, -it, -va, -ven

**For Baseline (varied, classical):**
- Any phonemes, prioritize "feels like a real name from somewhere"
