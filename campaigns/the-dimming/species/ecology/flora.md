# Flora of Keth'toh

Plants, fungi, and botanical life of the world.

## Trees & Large Plants

### Shimmerwood
- **Appearance**: Tall trees (10-15 metres) with bark that shifts between silver and deep blue. Leaves are translucent, refracting light into rainbow patterns.
- **Properties**: Wood retains light-refracting properties when cut; used for decorative items and light diffusion in buildings.
- **Habitat**: Temperate forests, especially near water sources.
- **Notes**: The shimmer effect comes from nanomachine colonies in the bark—the trees are essentially alive with dormant technology.

### Breathvine
- **Appearance**: Thick, rope-like vines that pulse with a slow rhythm (approximately one "breath" per minute).
- **Properties**: Actively filters toxins from air; settlements cultivate them around waste areas. Releases a faint sweet scent.
- **Habitat**: Grows on other structures; common in ruins and around settlements.
- **Cultural Significance**: Highly valued. Damaging breathvines is taboo in Vel'ashi culture—one of the few acts considered universally wrong.
- **Human Perspective**: Human researchers have studied their filtration mechanism extensively. They suspect the vines process air at a molecular level but cannot replicate the effect.

### Rootwalkers
- **Appearance**: Squat, bulbous trees with extensive above-ground root systems. Roots visibly shift position over days/weeks.
- **Properties**: Slowly mobile—will relocate toward water or away from threats over time. Harmless but unsettling to watch.
- **Habitat**: Arid regions, following seasonal water patterns.
- **Cultural Significance**: Vel'ashi consider them wise, patient beings. Some settlements consult rootwalker groves for long-term decisions (watching which direction the trees move over seasons).
- **Human Perspective**: Deeply unnerving to humans. The movement is too slow to see but too fast to ignore. Some researchers insist they're just responding to moisture gradients; others aren't so sure.

### Nightbloom
- **Appearance**: Black-leafed plants that only open in darkness. Flowers are bioluminescent blue-white.
- **Properties**: Provides natural lighting in dark environments. Petals can be harvested for temporary light sources (glow for 4-6 hours once picked).
- **Habitat**: Caves, dense forests, anywhere with consistent shade.
- **Cultural Significance**: Essential resource for Dark-adapted human communities. They cultivate nightbloom gardens in the Shadowed Reaches.

## Smaller Plants

### Mender Moss
- **Appearance**: Soft, green-gold moss that grows in patches. Warm to the touch.
- **Properties**: Accelerates healing when applied to wounds. Not a cure-all, but speeds recovery noticeably. Works on Vel'ashi and humans alike.
- **Habitat**: Damp rocks, cave entrances, ruins.
- **Gameplay**: Applying mender moss to a wound during a short rest grants +1 HP per Hit Die spent. Fresh moss is more effective than dried.
- **Notes**: The healing effect is nanomachine-mediated. If the network were disabled, mender moss would become ordinary moss.

### Dustcup
- **Appearance**: Small succulent with cup-shaped leaves that collect dew and dust.
- **Properties**: The collected liquid is safe to drink and mildly nutritious. A survival staple for travelers.
- **Habitat**: Arid regions, rocky terrain.
- **Cultural Significance**: Photosynthetic humans can partially sustain themselves on dustcup liquid—it's become culturally important to their communities.

### Whisper Grass
- **Appearance**: Tall, feathery grass that sways even without wind.
- **Properties**: Produces soft sounds in response to vibration—predators moving through it create a "whisper" that alerts prey.
- **Habitat**: Open plains, meadows.
- **Gameplay**: Stealth checks in whisper grass are made at disadvantage unless moving at half speed or slower.
- **Notes**: Makes ambush difficult; hunters must account for it. Evolved partly as a defense against burrowing maws.

## Fungi & Lichens

### Glowcap
- **Appearance**: Mushrooms with caps that phosphoresce in patterns. Colors vary by subspecies—green, blue, amber.
- **Properties**: Edible but mildly hallucinogenic in large quantities. The glow intensifies when touched.
- **Habitat**: Forest floors, rotting wood, cave entrances.
- **Cultural Significance**: Used in some Vel'ashi ceremonies. Humans have learned to avoid eating too many at once.

### Threadmold
- **Appearance**: Fine, gossamer-like fungal growth that spreads across surfaces. Nearly invisible until it catches light.
- **Properties**: Breaks down organic material rapidly. Useful for waste disposal but dangerous if it spreads to living tissue.
- **Habitat**: Anywhere with moisture and dead organic matter.
- **Danger**: Can cause "threadrot" if it infects wounds. Treatment requires careful removal and mender moss application.

### Stonecrust
- **Appearance**: Lichen that grows on rocks in concentric patterns. Colors range from rust-red to pale gray.
- **Properties**: Extremely slow-growing but incredibly durable. Used as a natural adhesive when ground and mixed with water.
- **Habitat**: Rocky terrain, ruins, mountain faces.
- **Notes**: Some ancient Keth'ashi structures used stonecrust as mortar—the buildings have lasted millennia.

## Dangerous Flora

### Lashvine
- **Appearance**: Resembles ordinary vines until disturbed. Then it moves.
- **Properties**: Reactive defensive plant—strikes at anything that touches it. Thorns inject a mild paralytic.
- **Habitat**: Dense forests, often growing near breathvine (which it mimics).
- **Danger Level**: Moderate. The paralytic wears off in minutes, but that's long enough for predators to find you.
- **Gameplay**: Creatures that touch lashvine must make a DC 12 CON save or be paralyzed for 1 minute.

### Sleepbloom
- **Appearance**: Beautiful flowers with deep purple petals and a sweet, heavy fragrance.
- **Properties**: Pollen is nanomachine-mediated, inducing drowsiness through direct neural interaction rather than simple chemistry. Heavy exposure causes unconsciousness with vivid dreams.
- **Habitat**: Clearings, meadow edges—anywhere pollinators gather.
- **Danger Level**: Low unless you linger.
- **Vel'ashi Understanding**: Used ritually when properly prepared—sleepbloom-induced dreams are considered prophetic. Shamanic traditions involve controlled exposure to receive visions. Casual travelers know to hold their breath when passing through patches.
- **Human Understanding**: Researchers have analyzed the pollen and found no chemical compound that explains its potency. The sedative effect is "biologically implausible."
- **Gameplay**: Creatures that spend more than 1 minute in a sleepbloom patch must make a DC 10 CON save or fall unconscious for 1d4 hours. Dreams during this sleep may contain GM-placed visions or clues.

### Hollowroot
- **Appearance**: Appears to be a normal shrub until you step on the ground above its root system—which is hollow.
- **Properties**: Creates concealed pit traps. The plant feeds on creatures that fall into its root cavity.
- **Habitat**: Forest edges, game trails.
- **Danger Level**: Moderate. Falls are rarely fatal, but being trapped while predators investigate is dangerous.
- **Gameplay**: DC 15 Perception to notice before stepping on. Victims fall into a 10-foot pit (1d6 damage) and must climb out.
