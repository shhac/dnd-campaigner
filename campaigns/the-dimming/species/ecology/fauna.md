# Fauna of Keth'toh

Creatures, predators, prey, and symbiotic organisms of the world.

---

## Predators

### Glintcats
- **Appearance**: Six-legged felines (Earth comparison: lynx-sized). Fur has a metallic sheen that shifts color with mood—chromatophore cells similar to shimmerbeasts, suggesting shared evolutionary ancestry.
- **Behavior**: Ambush predators; patient and intelligent. Known to work in mated pairs. Will stalk prey for hours before striking. Their unusual patience may be nanomachine-enhanced cognition.
- **Danger Level**: Moderate. Will avoid groups; dangerous to lone travelers at night.
- **Vel'ashi Understanding**: Glintcats are respected as clever hunters and feature in folk tales as trickster figures. Killing one without need is dishonorable. Some say they can sense intentions.
- **Human Understanding**: The mercenaries who attacked Nethara'kora used a trained glintcat to track her—proof that the creatures can be domesticated with effort. Researchers note their patience exceeds normal predator behavior.
- **What Neither Knows**: The metallic sheen in their fur contains trace nanomachine colonies. If the network fails, glintcats would lose their enhanced patience and color-shifting—becoming ordinary, more aggressive predators.
- **Gameplay**: AC 13, HP 22, +5 to hit, 1d6+3 slashing. Pack Tactics when hunting with a mate.

### Razorwings
- **Appearance**: Flying predators with wingspans of 2.5-4 metres. Bodies are angular, almost geometric. Wing edges are sharp enough to cut.
- **Behavior**: Hunt in flocks of 3-5. Circle prey before diving attacks. Extremely territorial.
- **Danger Level**: High when in groups. Single razorwings are cautious.
- **Cultural Significance**: Responsible for much of the evolutionary pressure that made Vel'ashi "prey-like." Ancient enemies.
- **Human Perspective**: Photosynthetic communities in the Brightlands have developed elaborate scarecrow systems and early warning networks.
- **Gameplay**: AC 14, HP 18, +4 to hit, 2d6 slashing on dive attacks. Flyby—doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

### Burrowing Maw
- **Appearance**: Rarely seen fully—mostly encountered as a circular mouth (1-1.2 metres diameter) emerging from soil. Body is worm-like, 4.5-6 metres long.
- **Behavior**: Ambush predator; waits beneath trails. Detects vibration. Swallows prey whole if possible.
- **Danger Level**: High. Best avoided rather than fought.
- **Cultural Significance**: Whisper grass evolved partly as a warning system against these. Vel'ashi children learn "maw drills"—how to move silently when crossing suspect terrain.
- **Gameplay**: AC 12, HP 45, +6 to hit, 2d8+4 piercing. Grapples on hit (DC 14 STR to escape). Underground tremorsense 60 ft.

### Shadowstalker
- **Appearance**: Low, sleek predator with chromatophores evolved to an extreme—they don't just shift color, they seem to absorb light. Difficult to see even in good conditions; in darkness, nearly invisible.
- **Behavior**: Solitary hunters. Prefer to bite once and follow prey until it weakens. Patient. Evolved in the Shadowed Reaches where light is scarce.
- **Danger Level**: Moderate. Their bite carries a nanomachine-derived anticoagulant—wounds bleed freely.
- **Vel'ashi Understanding**: Considered omens. Seeing a shadowstalker before a journey means reconsidering the trip. Some believe they guard the borders between worlds.
- **Human Understanding**: Dark-adapted researchers have studied them extensively. The light-absorption is biological but inexplicable by conventional optics.
- **What Neither Knows**: The anticoagulant is produced by symbiotic nanomachine colonies in their saliva. If the network fails, shadowstalker bites become far less dangerous—an inverted omen.
- **Gameplay**: AC 15, HP 27, +6 to hit, 1d8+3 piercing plus 1d4 ongoing bleed (stops if network-stressed). Advantage on Stealth in dim light or darkness.

## Grazers & Prey

### Shimmerbeasts
- **Appearance**: Herd animals resembling six-legged deer with chromatophore skin (can shift colors like Vel'ashi).
- **Behavior**: Travel in herds of 20-50. Excellent at camouflage; entire herds can "vanish" against terrain.
- **Danger Level**: Low. Will flee rather than fight, but stampedes are dangerous.
- **Cultural Significance**: Primary protein source for Vel'ashi settlements. Domesticated varieties exist. Treated with respect—hunting rituals thank the herd.
- **Gameplay**: AC 11, HP 9. Can Hide as a bonus action in natural terrain. Herd stampede: DC 12 DEX save or take 2d6 bludgeoning and be knocked prone.

### Stoneshells
- **Appearance**: Tortoise-like creatures with shells that incorporate actual mineral content. Range from dustrunner-sized to cart-sized.
- **Behavior**: Extremely slow. Graze on moss and lichens. Essentially harmless. Live for centuries.
- **Danger Level**: None (unless you're under one when it sits down).
- **Cultural Significance**: Shells are harvested for building material, but killing them is regulated—they take decades to mature. Some Vel'ashi settlements have "elder shells" that have lived among them for generations.
- **Human Perspective**: Researchers have tried to understand how the shells incorporate minerals. The process seems to involve nanomachine mediation.

### Flickerfish
- **Appearance**: Aquatic creatures that exist partially "out of phase"—they seem to flicker in and out of visibility.
- **Behavior**: School in large groups. The flickering confuses predators.
- **Danger Level**: None. Important food source for coastal communities.
- **Notes**: The phase-shifting is nanomachine-related. Human researchers have studied them extensively—the flickering effect was one of the first clues about the network's existence.

### Dustrunners
- **Appearance**: Small, fast rodent-like creatures with oversized hind legs. Fur is always dusty-colored regardless of actual environment.
- **Behavior**: Extremely fast. Burrow in loose soil. Travel in family groups.
- **Danger Level**: None. Common prey for glintcats and razorwings.
- **Cultural Significance**: Considered good luck if one crosses your path running left-to-right. Bad luck if right-to-left.

## Other Creatures

### Symbiotes (various)
- **Appearance**: Small organisms that bond with hosts—Vel'ashi and animals alike. Range from insect-like to slug-like.
- **Behavior**: Provide benefits to hosts (enhanced healing, sensory boost, toxin filtration) in exchange for nutrients.
- **Danger Level**: Varies. Some are beneficial; others parasitic. Telling the difference requires experience.
- **Notes**: The line between "symbiote" and "nanomachine colony" is blurry. Some may be biological; others may be technology wearing a biological disguise.
- **Cultural Significance**: Vel'ashi have relationships with beneficial symbiote species going back generations. Certain lineages traditionally host certain symbiotes.

**Common Symbiote Types:**

| Symbiote | Appearance | Benefit | Host Lineage |
|----------|------------|---------|--------------|
| **Breathkeeper** | Gill-like fronds behind the ear | Extended breath-holding (up to 10 minutes) | Coastal diving families, 'rin suffix |
| **Woundsealer** | Slug-like, nestles in shoulder hollow | Accelerated clotting, +1 HP per short rest | Warrior lineages, 'rath suffix |
| **Nighteye** | Insect-like, bonds behind ear | Darkvision 30 ft, but light sensitivity | Cave-dwelling families, 'mori suffix |
| **Toxinfilter** | Internal, nearly invisible | Advantage on saves vs poison | Herbalist lineages, 'sari suffix |

**Gameplay**: Acquiring a symbiote requires finding a colony and undergoing a bonding ritual. Symbiotes die within days if the host dies or if the nanomachine network fails.

### Void Moths
- **Appearance**: Large moths (wingspan 30-60 cm) that appear to absorb light. Looking at them feels like looking at a hole in reality.
- **Behavior**: Nocturnal. Drawn to nanomachine-rich areas. Harmless but unsettling.
- **Danger Level**: None, but their presence often indicates something interesting nearby—ancient sites, artifacts, network nodes.
- **Cultural Significance**: Vel'ashi folklore considers them messengers from the ancestors. If void moths gather somewhere, it's worth investigating.
- **Human Perspective**: Researchers have tried to capture and study them. The moths die quickly in captivity, and their bodies seem to dissolve rather than decay normally.

### Echo Lizards
- **Appearance**: Small reptiles with oversized ears. Scales form geometric patterns.
- **Behavior**: Communicate via ultrasonic chirps. Social and curious. Often found near Dark-adapted human settlements (mutual benefit—the lizards eat pests).
- **Danger Level**: None. Often kept as pets.
- **Cultural Significance**: Can be trained to alert to specific sounds—natural alarm systems. Dark-adapted communities value them highly.

### Spinners
- **Appearance**: Spider-like but with eight legs arranged in four pairs. Bodies are geometric, almost crystalline. Webs shimmer with rainbow light.
- **Behavior**: Web-builders. Webs are incredibly strong—used for rope and fabric by those who know how to harvest them safely.
- **Danger Level**: Low. Bite is painful but not dangerous. The real risk is blundering into a web and attracting the spinner's attention.
- **Cultural Significance**: Spinner-silk clothing is a status symbol among Vel'ashi. Harvesting requires permission from the spinner colony (or so tradition says).

### Chorus Frogs
- **Appearance**: Small amphibians with iridescent skin. Eyes are disproportionately large.
- **Behavior**: Gather in large groups near water. Their calls synchronize in patterns that seem almost musical—sometimes hauntingly beautiful.
- **Danger Level**: None.
- **Cultural Significance**: Their calls are considered good omens. Vel'ashi sometimes time important ceremonies to coincide with chorus frog gatherings.
- **Human Perspective**: Researchers have analyzed the call patterns. They seem to contain more information than simple mating calls—but what information, no one knows.

### Boneweavers
- **Appearance**: Scavengers resembling a cross between a beetle and a crab, sized from fist to glintcat. Multiple limbs end in delicate manipulators.
- **Behavior**: Feed on dead matter. Notably, they arrange bones and shells into structures—nests, barriers, decorative patterns.
- **Danger Level**: None unless you disturb their bone-constructs.
- **Cultural Significance**: Their constructs are sometimes used as crude divination—what patterns did the boneweavers make from this season's dead?
- **Human Perspective**: The construction behavior is inexplicable. No evolutionary advantage has been identified.

## Aquatic Creatures

### Phosphor Jellies
- **Appearance**: Translucent jellyfish that glow with soft blue-green light. Range from palm-sized to person-sized. Responsible for the "phosphorescent seas" visible from shore.
- **Behavior**: Drift in vast schools. The glow intensifies when disturbed, creating cascading light displays.
- **Danger Level**: Low. Sting is painful but not dangerous to adults.
- **Cultural Significance**: Vel'ashi coastal communities time certain ceremonies to phosphor jelly blooms. The light is considered ancestral blessing.
- **Human Perspective**: Researchers have tried to study the glow mechanism. Like most Keth'toh bioluminescence, it exceeds what chemistry alone should produce.

### Deepsingers
- **Appearance**: Large whale-like creatures, rarely seen—mostly known from their calls, which carry for miles underwater.
- **Behavior**: Migrate seasonally. Their songs seem to contain structured information—too complex for simple communication.
- **Danger Level**: None. They ignore surface vessels entirely.
- **Cultural Significance**: Vel'ashi coastal legends speak of the deepsingers as record-keepers, singing the history of the world into the ocean. Hearing their song is considered profound.
- **What Neither Knows**: The songs may actually be nanomachine network maintenance routines, transmitted acoustically across ocean basins.

### Tidepool Crawlers
- **Appearance**: Crab-like creatures with shells that incorporate colorful minerals. Claws can deliver a sharp pinch.
- **Behavior**: Scavengers in the tidal zone. Gather in large numbers at low tide.
- **Danger Level**: None unless you're careless with bare feet.
- **Cultural Significance**: Collected for food and decorative shells. Children learn to gather them safely.

## Small Life

### Shimmer Mites
- **Appearance**: Tiny insects with iridescent wings. Travel in swarms that catch light beautifully.
- **Behavior**: Pollinators for most Keth'toh flowering plants, including sleepbloom. Active during twilight hours.
- **Notes**: Their chromatophore wings suggest they share the same nanomachine adaptation as larger creatures. Swarms sometimes move in synchronized patterns that seem almost purposeful.

### Needleflies
- **Appearance**: Mosquito-equivalent. Thin, fast, annoying. Proboscis is painfully sharp.
- **Behavior**: Blood-feeders. Active near water, especially at dawn and dusk.
- **Danger Level**: Annoyance. Unlike Earth mosquitoes, they don't carry diseases—nanomachine integration prevents pathogen transmission.
- **Human Perspective**: Photosynthetic humans attract fewer needleflies (their blood is less nutritious). Dark-adapted humans attract more.

### Clickbugs
- **Appearance**: Beetle-like insects that communicate through clicking sounds. Bioluminescent abdomens.
- **Behavior**: Nocturnal. Their clicking forms a constant background noise in forests at night.
- **Cultural Significance**: Vel'ashi children catch them in jars for temporary lanterns. The clicking is considered soothing.

## Avian Creatures

### Trillwings
- **Appearance**: Small flying creatures with four wings arranged in an X-pattern. Feathers shift color subtly with mood and temperature. Most are palm-sized, with the largest species reaching the size of a clenched fist.
- **Behavior**: Highly vocal—their calls range from melodic trills to sharp warning clicks. Travel in loose flocks. Nest in shimmerwood groves and along cliff faces. Active dawn and dusk.
- **Danger Level**: None. Occasionally steal small shiny objects.
- **Cultural Significance**: Vel'ashi read trillwing behavior for weather prediction and danger warnings. A flock going silent means something is wrong. Their dawn chorus is considered a blessing on new endeavors.
- **Human Perspective**: Photosynthetic communities appreciate trillwings as pest control. Dark-adapted humans find their clicking calls useful for echolocation reference.
- **What Neither Knows**: Trillwing flock coordination—hundreds moving as one—is nanomachine-mediated. If the network fails, flocks would fragment into chaotic, less effective groups.
- **Notes**: Many Vel'ashi can imitate specific trillwing calls. It's considered a basic wilderness skill, useful for signaling across distances or calming nervous flocks.

### Duskgliders
- **Appearance**: Larger avian creatures (wingspan about 60 cm) with broad, silent wings. Dark plumage with bioluminescent markings along wing edges.
- **Behavior**: Nocturnal hunters. Prey on needleflies, clickbugs, and small ground creatures. Silent flight—often only noticed by the absence of other night sounds.
- **Danger Level**: None to humanoids. Occasionally startling.
- **Cultural Significance**: Considered guides in the dark. Vel'ashi traveling at night take comfort in seeing duskgliders—it means the path is relatively safe.
- **Notes**: The bioluminescent wing markings pulse in patterns during mating displays, creating eerie light shows in the night sky.

## Dangerous Creatures

### Memoryfish
- **Appearance**: Freshwater fish with oversized, complex eyes. Scales reflect images like mirrors.
- **Behavior**: When threatened, they "broadcast" images that confuse predators—often showing the predator's own memories or fears.
- **Danger Level**: Moderate. The memory effect can be disorienting, especially in groups.
- **Cultural Significance**: Fishing for memoryfish is a test of mental discipline. Some Vel'ashi use the experience as a coming-of-age trial.
- **Gameplay**: Creatures within 30 feet of a threatened memoryfish must make a DC 12 WIS save or be stunned until the end of their next turn as memories flood their mind.

### Mirrorbeast
- **Appearance**: No consistent appearance—mimics other creatures. The disguise is imperfect; something always seems slightly wrong.
- **Behavior**: Lures prey by appearing as something harmless or desirable. Reveals its true form only when attacking.
- **Danger Level**: High. The true form is a mass of teeth and claws.
- **Cultural Significance**: "Mirrorbeast" is used as an insult for deceptive people.
- **Gameplay**: AC 14, HP 35, +5 to hit, 2d6+3 slashing. Shapechanger ability (imperfect—DC 15 Insight to notice something wrong).
