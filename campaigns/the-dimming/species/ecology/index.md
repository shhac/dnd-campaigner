# Ecology of Keth'toh

## Overview

Keth'toh's biosphere is deeply intertwined with the nanomachine network that permeates the planet. While the network's true nature is unknown to most inhabitants, its effects are visible everywhere: plants that heal wounds, animals with impossible abilities, and an ecosystem that seems almost *cooperative* rather than purely competitive.

## Biomes

### The Shimmerwood
Dense forests of shimmerwood trees. High biodiversity, good hunting, but easy to get lost as the light plays tricks. The canopy creates a constantly shifting light show that disorients newcomers.

### The Dust Plains
Arid expanses with rootwalker groves and dustcup fields. Home to burrowing maws—travel carefully. Water is scarce but dustcups make survival possible.

### The Shadowed Reaches
A region of deep canyons and cave systems. Nightbloom forests, Dark-adapted human settlements, and ancient Keth'ashi ruins. Perpetual twilight in the deeper sections.

### The Brightlands
Open terrain with intense solar exposure. Photosynthetic human communities thrive here. Razorwings are common, making travel dangerous for the unprepared.

### The Wound
A massive scar in the landscape—possibly ground zero of the Collapse. Strange phenomena, high nanomachine activity, avoided by most. The Keth'vorah maintain a small presence here but discourage visitors.

### The Coastal Margins
Where land meets the phosphorescent seas. Tidal pools filled with flickerfish, colonies of filter-feeding organisms, and the occasional trading settlement. Less explored than inland regions.

## GM Notes

### Signs of the Dimming

As the researchers' experiments at Second Anchor intensify, the network may show stress. Use these signs to foreshadow the threat:

**Subtle (Investigation DC 15 to notice)**
- Mender moss patches that are cooler than usual, healing more slowly
- Shimmerwood trees with muted, static colors instead of shifting patterns
- Void moths congregating in larger than normal numbers
- Whisper grass falling silent in small patches

**Obvious (Investigation DC 10)**
- Flickerfish staying visible for longer periods before phasing
- Breathvines with irregular, stuttering rhythms instead of steady pulses
- Shimmerbeasts with patchy, inconsistent camouflage
- Symbiotes becoming sluggish or detaching from hosts temporarily
- Trillwing flocks moving erratically, losing their synchronized coordination

**Critical (Automatic)**
- Symbiotes dying or permanently detaching
- Shimmerbeasts and Vel'ashi losing chromatophore abilities entirely
- Mender moss becoming ordinary, cold moss
- Breathvines stopping entirely - dead vines

**Narrative Use**: These signs should appear gradually as the party approaches Second Anchor or as the researchers' experiments escalate. Early sessions might show subtle signs that players dismiss; later sessions reveal the pattern.

### Nanomachine Integration

All life on Keth'toh has been shaped by the nanomachine network over millennia. The creatures and plants described in the ecology files are what the network has produced—a biosphere optimized for stability and self-repair.

**If the network were disabled ("the Dimming"):**
- Mender moss would lose healing properties
- Shimmerbeasts and Vel'ashi would lose chromatophore abilities
- Flickerfish would become visible (and quickly go extinct—easy prey)
- Breathvines would stop filtering
- Symbiotes would die or become purely parasitic
- The entire ecosystem would collapse within months

### Using Ecology in Play

**When to reference these files:**
- Party travels through new terrain → describe local flora/fauna
- Survival checks → what resources are available?
- Combat encounters → local predators, environmental hazards
- Investigation → what lives here? What's unusual?
- Worldbuilding moments → how do locals interact with nature?

**Narrative Integration:**
The ecology should feel alive and present. Describe breathvines pulsing on ruins, whisper grass reacting to movement, void moths circling ancient sites. The world responds to the party's presence.

### Encounter Seeds

- A shimmerbeast herd blocks the path, camouflaged and wary
- Void moths congregating around an ancient ruin entrance
- A burrowing maw's territory must be crossed
- Glintcats stalking the party at twilight
- A rootwalker grove has moved onto a vital trail
- Symbiote infestation in a settlement—beneficial or dangerous?
- Razorwing flock circling overhead, deciding whether to attack
- Trillwings suddenly going silent—something dangerous nearby
- Duskgliders leading travelers safely through night passages

### Human vs Vel'ashi Understanding

Humans have studied Keth'toh's ecology for 200 years with scientific methodology. They've catalogued species, documented behaviors, and run experiments. Their knowledge is systematic but shallow—they know *what* happens but rarely *why*.

Vel'ashi have lived within this ecology for millennia. Their knowledge is intuitive, cultural, and often more accurate—but expressed in terms of tradition, taboo, and folklore rather than scientific analysis. They know breathvines are sacred without knowing they're nanomachine filtration systems.

When characters discuss ecology, their species shapes their perspective:
- Humans measure, categorize, theorize
- Vel'ashi feel, respect, accommodate
