# Session 1: Beat Sheet

**Opening State**: The party has just received the Eth'koru from dying Nethara'kora. The common room of the Layered Rest is silent. Other patrons are watching.

---

## Beat 1: The Immediate Aftermath

**Goal**: Establish the party, give them space to react, introduce the first authority figure

### What Happens
- The common room remains frozen for a long moment
- Morvethri (the innkeeper) approaches carefully - offers practical help (blanket for the body, water for those in shock)
- Other patrons whisper; some leave quietly (they don't want to be involved)
- **5-10 minutes later**: Constable Koresh'rath arrives

### Party Opportunities
- Examine the Eth'koru (it pulses with inner light, needle-beam points west)
- Talk to Morvethri (she's shaken but helpful)
- Question witnesses (most saw the same thing - woman stumbled in, collapsed, gave them something)
- Attempt to leave before the constable arrives (Morvethri will advise against this)

### Tone
Tense but not hostile. The world is watching to see what they do.

## Beat 2: The Constable's Questions

**Goal**: Create productive tension, establish party's relationship with authority, provide information

### What Happens
- Koresh'rath arrives with one deputy
- He's calm, methodical, not accusatory
- He's already interviewed witnesses on his way in
- He asks the party to explain what happened

### Key Questions
1. "Who are you, and why are you in Dustmeet?"
2. "Did you know Nethara'kora before today?"
3. "Why did she give the artifact to you specifically?"
4. "What do you intend to do with it?"

### Possible Outcomes
- **Cooperative**: Koresh'rath is satisfied. Warns them the artifact will draw attention. Offers regional information if asked.
- **Evasive**: He grows more suspicious. May ask them to remain in Dustmeet while he investigates further. Not arrest, but soft detention.
- **Hostile**: He calls for backup. Does not want a confrontation, but will not be bullied. This should be avoidable if players are reasonable.

### Information He Can Provide (if cooperative)
- Nethara'kora arrived yesterday, already wounded
- "Hard-eyed humans" passed through recently, asking about a Vel'ashi woman traveling alone
- The Eth'koru is pointing west - toward the abandoned Second Anchor
- The Keth'vorah will eventually send someone; they don't ignore dead investigators

---

## Beat 3: Processing and Planning

**Goal**: Give the party time to discuss, establish relationships, make initial decisions

### What Happens
- Koresh'rath leaves (whether satisfied or not)
- Morvethri offers them rooms - on the house, given what they witnessed
- The evening settles; they have time to talk privately
- The Eth'koru continues pulsing, pointing west

### Party Opportunities
- Character introductions and relationship establishment (especially if playing new characters)
- Examine the Eth'koru more carefully (Korimeth's expertise, Detect Magic)
- Question Morvethri further (she'll open up more in private)
- Plan their next move

### Key Decisions to Prompt
- Do they follow the Eth'koru's guidance immediately?
- Do they investigate what happened to Nethara'kora first?
- Do they contact the Keth'vorah?
- Do they try to learn more about the "hard-eyed humans"?

---

## Beat 4: The Night's Visitor (Optional)

**Goal**: Add urgency, establish the threat is real

### What Happens
Only if the session needs more tension or the party seems inclined to wait:
- During the night, someone attempts to break into their rooms
- They flee when discovered
- Left behind: evidence they were searching for something specific (the artifact)

### Evidence of the Threat
- Human boot prints
- A dropped item (flash charge casing, Third Anchor security badge, note with Nethara'kora's description)
- If pursued, the intruder escapes but they confirm: muscular, military bearing, human

This establishes that waiting in Dustmeet may not be safe. The people who killed Nethara'kora are still looking for the artifact.

---

## Session End States

### Strong Ending Points
1. **After the constable leaves** - natural pause, party has decisions to make
2. **After the night's discussion** - party has a plan, ready to act on it next session
3. **After the night's visitor** - clear threat established, urgency to move

### Open Threads for Session 2
- What happened to Nethara'kora? (Who attacked her, why?)
- Who are the "hard-eyed humans"?
- What is Second Anchor, and why does the Eth'koru point there?
- Should they contact the Keth'vorah before proceeding?
- How long before whoever attacked Nethara'kora comes for them?

## GM Notes

### Pacing
- Don't rush the aftermath - let players absorb the hook
- The constable scene should take time; it's the first real NPC interaction
- If players want to roleplay character introductions, encourage it

### Combat Considerations
- The party is level 1 - avoid lethal combat this session
- The night visitor (if used) flees rather than fights
- If the party picks a fight with the constable, Dustmeet militia can detain them non-lethally

### Character Spotlights
- **Silani**: Natural fit for talking to Koresh'rath (diplomacy)
- **Korimeth**: Natural fit for examining the Eth'koru (expertise)
- **Thaneshi**: Might notice environmental details others miss
- **Eamon**: Second Anchor means something to him - watch for reactions when it's mentioned

### The Eth'koru
Currently pointing west toward Second Anchor. If examined:
- Warm to the touch
- Pulses with rhythmic inner light
- The needle-beam is faint but visible in dim conditions
- Detect Magic reveals it is magical (divination school) but the magic is strange - not Vel'ashi tradition, not human technology
- It does not respond to commands, but its pulsing intensifies when pointed directly at its target
