# Party Knowledge

**Campaign**: The Dimming
**Last Updated**: Session 0 (Campaign Start)

> This file contains information the ENTIRE PARTY knows. AI players should read this file when invoked.

> **AI Players**: This is YOUR source of truth for shared knowledge. If it's not here, your character doesn't know it (unless it's in your personal journal).

## Current Situation

**Location**: Dustmeet, inside the Layered Rest (inn and trading house)
**Time**: Late afternoon, amber light fading
**What's happening**: A Vel'ashi woman named Nethara'kora has just died in our presence. She gave us a strange artifact and begged us to stop something called "the Dimming."

**Party Formation**:
- Gathered around where Nethara'kora fell
- Other patrons watching from their tables
- The innkeeper Morvethri (called "Veth" by most) is nearby, uncertain what to do

## Active Quests

### The Investigator's Charge
- **Objective**: Follow the artifact's guidance and stop "the Dimming"
- **Given by**: Nethara'kora (now deceased)
- **What we know**: She was wounded, fevered, frightened. She mentioned she was Keth'vorah - one of the ancient order that preserves old knowledge. She said the "old dark" was returning.
- **Current progress**: Just received this mission. We know nothing else.

## NPCs We've Met

| NPC | Who They Are | Our Relationship | Last Interaction |
|-----|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| Nethara'kora | Keth'vorah investigator | She gave us her mission | Died in our presence |
| Morvethri (Veth) | Owner of the Layered Rest | Neutral | Witnessed the death with us |

## Locations We've Visited

### Dustmeet
- **What it is**: A trading post where paths converge, neutral ground for Vel'ashi and humans
- **What we found/did there**: Witnessed Nethara'kora's death, received the Eth'koru

## Important Information Learned

- The Keth'vorah are an ancient order that preserves pre-Collapse knowledge
- Nethara'kora was investigating something that frightened her badly
- The artifact she gave us is called the Eth'koru - it pulses with inner light and points like a compass
- "The Dimming" is some kind of threat she believed would end everything
- The Eth'koru currently points west, toward the abandoned Second Anchor settlement

## Party Resources

**Gold**: Starting equipment only
**Notable Items**:
- The Eth'koru (compass artifact) - held by the party collectively

## Recent Session Summary

### Session 0
This is the beginning. We were in Dustmeet when Nethara'kora, a wounded Keth'vorah investigator, stumbled into the Layered Rest. She died in our presence but not before giving us the Eth'koru and charging us with stopping "the Dimming." We don't know what that means yet, but the artifact pulses in our hands and points toward something.

## Unresolved Questions

- What is "the Dimming" that Nethara'kora feared?
- What wounded her?
- Why does the Eth'koru point west toward the abandoned Second Anchor?
- Should we contact the Keth'vorah about her death?
- What will the local authorities think of us holding a dead woman's artifact?

## World Knowledge (Common Understanding)

> **GM Note**: Full species and ecology details are in the `species/` directory for reference. The summaries below reflect what characters commonly know.


### About Keth'toh
- This is our world. Humans call it Chalawan-II, but the proper name is Keth'toh.
- The Collapse happened thousands of years ago - long before humans arrived, something terrible ended the old civilization
- What caused the Collapse is unknown; the Keth'vorah preserve fragments of knowledge but even they have only pieces
- Knowledge from before is fragmentary; technology decays and cannot be replaced

### About the Vel'ashi
- The native people of Keth'toh
- Shorter than humans (4'8" to 5'6"), with subtle shape-shifting abilities (camouflage, minor appearance changes)
- Skin tones range from deep blue-grey to pale violet; eyes are large with horizontal pupils
- Ancient name was Keth'ashi, but few remember this
- Ancient imagery shows ancestors who looked different - more muscular, larger heads - most Vel'ashi don't recognize them as ancestors
- Slang for humans: "Sky'ashi" (sky-people) - references their extraterrestrial origin

### About Humans
- Arrived approximately 200 years ago; call this world Chalawan-II
- Three main variants:
  - **Photosynthetic**: Greenish skin, can partially sustain on sunlight, suffer in prolonged darkness
  - **Dark-adapted**: Pale skin, large reflective eyes, superior darkvision, suffer in bright light
  - **Cybernetic**: Visible tech implants, enhanced capabilities, require maintenance
- Three main settlements:
  - **First Anchor**: The original landing site, still populated. Serves as the ceremonial hub for humanity on Keth'toh - smaller than Third Anchor but culturally important.
  - **Second Anchor**: An old mining settlement, abandoned about 70 years ago. People don't like to talk about why. The buildings still stand, slowly being reclaimed by native growth.
  - **Third Anchor**: The largest settlement and center of human governance.
  - **Second Anchor**: An old mining settlement, abandoned about 70 years ago. People don't like to talk about why. The buildings still stand, slowly being reclaimed by native growth. Rumors say a research team has recently moved in, but details are scarce.
- "Gone native" is an insult among them
- Both species share legends of a "Lost Colony" - humans who arrived roughly 500 years ago, long before the current settlers. The colony was lost about 400 years ago under mysterious circumstances. Their ruins exist in remote regions, and scattered human artifacts occasionally surface in unexpected places. No one knows what happened to them, but their presence explains why Vel'ashi already knew about humans when the current settlers arrived - they had met sky-people before, even if it was outside living memory.

### About Human Technology
- Humans brought advanced technology from their homeworld, but cannot manufacture replacements
- Working equipment is rare, valuable, and carefully maintained
- **Technology sharing is restricted**: Humans generally do not share technology with Vel'ashi - officially due to compatibility issues, unofficially because it represents their only advantage on Keth'toh
- Some simple items occasionally appear in Vel'ashi hands through trade with "gone native" intermediaries
- Most Vel'ashi are uninterested anyway - their abilities make human equipment seem clunky and unnecessary

### About Relations
- Wary coexistence
- Vel'ashi are the dominant presence; humans are tolerated guests
- Separate governance; trading posts like Dustmeet serve as neutral ground

### Common Flora & Fauna

> **Note**: Vel'ashi and humans know the same creatures but understand them differently. Vel'ashi knowledge is intuitive and cultural; human knowledge is scientific but often misses deeper truths.

**Plants**:
- **Shimmerwood**: Trees with light-refracting bark; forests can be disorienting
  - *Vel'ashi*: The shimmer is the trees dreaming. Cutting shimmerwood for trivial purposes is disrespectful.
  - *Human*: The optical properties are remarkable but unexplained. Researchers have studied them for decades.
- **Mender moss**: Warm moss that helps wounds heal faster
  - *Vel'ashi*: A gift from the ancestors. Apply it with thanks.
  - *Human*: The healing acceleration is measurable but the mechanism is unknown. No chemical compound explains it.
- **Breathvines**: Pulsing vines that clean the air
  - *Vel'ashi*: Sacred. Damaging them is taboo—one of the few acts considered universally wrong.
  - *Human*: Filters toxins at a molecular level. Researchers cannot replicate the effect.
- **Whisper grass**: Grass that rustles in response to movement, even without wind
  - *Vel'ashi*: The land warning its children.
  - *Human*: Natural alarm system. Makes ambush nearly impossible.

**Creatures**:
- **Shimmerbeasts**: Herd animals with camouflage abilities; primary meat source
  - *Vel'ashi*: Treated with respect. Hunting rituals thank the herd.
  - *Human*: The chromatophore mechanism is similar to Vel'ashi skin. Related evolution?
- **Glintcats**: Six-legged predators with metallic, color-shifting fur
  - *Vel'ashi*: Respected as clever hunters. Killing one without need is dishonorable.
  - *Human*: Can be domesticated with effort. Unusually patient for predators.
- **Razorwings**: Flying predators with blade-like wings; hunt in flocks
  - *Vel'ashi*: Ancient enemies. The reason we learned to hide.
  - *Human*: Territorial and dangerous. Photosynthetic communities have early warning systems.
- **Void moths**: Large moths that seem to absorb light
  - *Vel'ashi*: Messengers from the ancestors. If they gather somewhere, it's significant.
  - *Human*: Die quickly in captivity. Bodies dissolve rather than decay. Unsettling.
- **Burrowing maws**: Worm-like ambush predators beneath trails
  - *Vel'ashi*: Children learn "maw drills"—how to move silently across suspect terrain.
  - *Human*: Detect vibration. Whisper grass evolved partly as warning against them.
- **Trillwings**: Small four-winged avians with color-shifting feathers; highly vocal
  - *Vel'ashi*: Read their behavior for weather and danger warnings. A flock going silent means trouble.
  - *Human*: Useful pest control. Their calls help Dark-adapted communities navigate.

**Symbiotes**:
Some Vel'ashi lineages host beneficial symbiotic creatures:
- **Breathkeeper**: Allows extended breath-holding (coastal diving families)
- **Woundsealer**: Accelerates clotting (warrior lineages)
- **Nighteye**: Grants limited darkvision but causes light sensitivity (cave-dwellers)

Humans generally find symbiotes disturbing and rarely host them.
