# The Eth'koru

**Type**: Ancient Artifact / Diagnostic Tool
**Rarity**: Unique
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Description

A palm-sized orb of dark metal, smooth and warm to the touch. It weighs more than it should, as if it contains something denser than its size suggests. The surface is unmarred by age despite being ancient beyond memory.

When active, the Eth'koru pulses with inner light - a soft glow that shifts between amber and pale blue. A needle-like beam forms within its depths, always pointing toward something. The beam moves slowly, tracking targets that may be thousands of miles away.

## Properties

### Known Properties (Party can discover through use)

**Compass Function**: The Eth'koru points toward locations of significance. What "significance" means is unclear - it seems drawn to places where something important is happening or about to happen. Currently, it points steadily west toward Second Anchor.

**Warmth**: The artifact is always slightly warm. It grows warmer when approaching locations it points toward, and noticeably cooler if carried in the wrong direction.

**Responsiveness**: Attentive handlers will notice the artifact seems to react to their intent. When the party discusses their mission, the light pulses slightly. When they consider abandoning the quest, it dims.

### Hidden Properties (GM Knowledge)

**Network Interface**: The Eth'koru is a diagnostic and navigation tool from the original nanomachine network. It can detect disruptions, guide users to control nodes, and - in skilled hands - interface with the network directly.

**Memory Storage**: The artifact contains recordings from its previous users, including ancient Keth'ashi who understood what it truly was. These memories might be accessed under specific circumstances.

**Awakening Cause**: The Eth'koru was dormant for millennia. It awakened when Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura's equipment at Second Anchor began active scanning of the nanomachine network. It's not pointing at Second Anchor by coincidence - it's responding to a threat.

**Full Activation**: The artifact is currently in passive mode. With proper understanding, it could be fully activated, granting the ability to perceive the nanomachine network directly and possibly influence it.

## History

The Eth'koru was created before the Collapse by the Keth'ashi (ancient Vel'ashi) as a tool for maintaining the planetary nanomachine network. There were originally many such devices. This is the only one known to have survived.

After the Collapse, the Eth'koru was found by early Keth'vorah founders, dormant and inert. They didn't understand what it was, only that it was important. It was stored in a secure cache for generations, studied periodically, never activated.

When the human researchers began their experiments, the Eth'koru woke. Nethara'kora was sent to retrieve it and determine why. She learned more than she expected - more than she could bear - and fled toward Dustmeet with the artifact, pursued by those who would use it for purposes she couldn't allow.

## Plot Significance

The Eth'koru is the party's guide through the campaign. It will:
- Lead them to locations relevant to the main plot
- React to story developments, providing subtle cues
- Eventually reveal deeper truths about Keth'toh's nature
- Potentially serve as a tool in the final confrontation with Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura

## Mechanics

For gameplay purposes:

**Navigation**: Once per day, a character can attune to the Eth'koru (requires 10 minutes of quiet focus). When attuned, they sense the general direction and distance to the nearest location of plot significance. This doesn't guarantee safety - it might lead to danger.

**Threat Warning**: The artifact pulses more rapidly when significant danger approaches. This grants advantage on Perception checks against threats related to the main plot.

**Growing Connection**: As the campaign progresses, the Eth'koru will reveal more capabilities. The party might learn to access memories, interface with ancient sites, or use it to disrupt the researchers' equipment.

## Current Status

**Location**: With the party (exact holder to be determined)
**Active**: Yes, pointing toward Second Anchor
**Condition**: Undamaged, functioning
**Known to Others**: The Keth'vorah know it exists; the human researchers are actively searching for it
