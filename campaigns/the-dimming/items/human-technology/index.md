# Human Technology on Keth'toh

## Overview

Human technology on Keth'toh exists in a state of careful maintenance rather than active development. The colony ships brought manufacturing capacity, but the scale of industry required to build new complex equipment was never established. Instead, humans have become expert at maintaining, repairing, and occasionally repurposing the equipment their ancestors brought.

This creates a society where technology is respected, hoarded, and fiercely protected. A working communicator or medical scanner is worth more than its weight in trade goods because it cannot be replaced once it fails.

## Technology Philosophy

### Why Humans Don't Share

Human settlements maintain a strict policy against sharing technology with Vel'ashi. This policy has several justifications, some stated publicly and others understood but unspoken:

**Official Reasons**:
- "The technology requires infrastructure to maintain that doesn't exist outside human settlements"
- "Training requirements would take years, and we don't have the personnel"
- "Compatibility issues - the equipment was designed for human users"

**Actual Concerns**:
- Fear that technological advantage is the only leverage humans have on Keth'toh
- Belief that Vel'ashi "magic" makes technology sharing unfair in the other direction
- Concern that widespread distribution would accelerate equipment degradation
- Historical tensions from early settlement conflicts

**Enforcement**: Sharing technology with Vel'ashi is not illegal, but it is strongly discouraged. Humans who do so face social consequences - exclusion from certain services, reduced citizenship priority, and professional blacklisting.

**Exceptions**: Some technology sharing does occur through trade, particularly with "gone native" humans who serve as intermediaries. Simple items like flashlights occasionally appear in Vel'ashi hands, but complex equipment almost never does.

### Vel'ashi Perspective

Most Vel'ashi are uninterested in human technology. Their shape-shifting abilities and connection to the Keth'ashi (nanomachine network, though they do not know this term) provide capabilities that make human equipment redundant or inferior.

Some younger or more curious Vel'ashi are fascinated by human devices, seeing them as interesting puzzles. The Keth'vorah has a standing policy of acquiring human technology for study, though they rarely share what they learn.

## Notable Technology Gaps

### What Humans Don't Have

- **Air travel**: No functional aircraft remain. Travel is by foot, beast, or the occasional ground vehicle.
- **Orbital capability**: The colony ships are derelict or dismantled. Humans cannot leave Keth'toh.
- **Manufacturing at scale**: Small-batch fabrication exists, but mass production does not.
- **Advanced AI**: Some computational assistance exists in research facilities, but nothing approaching true artificial intelligence.
- **Weapons of mass destruction**: Either never brought or deliberately destroyed by early colonists.

### What Seems Like It Should Exist But Doesn't

- **Neural interfaces**: The colony ships had them, but they failed within a generation on Keth'toh. Something about the local environment (actually nanomachine interference) makes them unreliable.
- **Genetic modification beyond the variants**: The three human variants emerged from deliberate adaptation, but further modification has been abandoned. Again, something interferes.
- **Reliable automation**: Robots and automated systems fail more often on Keth'toh than they should. Most settlements have returned to human labor for critical tasks.
