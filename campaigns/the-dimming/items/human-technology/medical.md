# Human Medical Equipment

## Trauma Injector

**Original Purpose**: Emergency medical equipment for field use. Designed to stabilize critically injured personnel long enough to reach proper medical facilities.

**How They Work**: The injector delivers a cocktail of synthetic compounds - coagulants, painkillers, stimulants, and cellular repair accelerants - directly into the patient's bloodstream. The formulation was designed for human physiology but provides reduced benefit to Vel'ashi (their different biology limits effectiveness).

**Appearance**: A palm-sized cylindrical device with a pressure-activated needle. Single-use - once triggered, the injector is spent.

### Combat Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Activation** | Action (on self or adjacent ally) |
| **Healing** | 2d8+2 HP |
| **Stabilization** | Automatically stabilizes a dying creature (no death saves needed) |
| **Uses** | Single use - the injector is consumed |
| **Vel'ashi Targets** | Half healing (round down) due to biological differences |

### Practical Considerations

**Cost and Availability**: A trauma injector represents approximately a week's wages for a skilled worker. They are not rare, but they are not cheap either. Most humans who travel outside settlements carry one or two for emergencies; carrying more is a sign of either wealth or dangerous work.

**Resupply**: Settlement medical facilities can refill empty injector casings, but this requires:
- Access to the medical facility (citizenship or payment)
- Availability of the chemical compounds (sometimes rationed)
- A functional empty casing (injectors degrade after multiple refills)

**Field Limitations**: The injector heals damage but does not cure disease, poison, or magical effects. It is emergency medicine, not a cure-all.

### GM Notes

**Loot Value**: Trauma injectors are excellent loot - valuable enough to matter, consumable so they do not permanently increase party power, and universally useful.

**Tension Building**: The single-use nature creates meaningful decisions. "Do we use the injector now, or save it for something worse?"

**NPC Equipment**: Most human NPCs who travel carry 1-2 injectors. Well-funded operations (research teams, military units) might carry more. Finding an NPC with no medical supplies suggests either poverty, desperation, or something suspicious.

## Flash Charge

**Original Purpose**: Crowd dispersal and tactical entry equipment. Designed to disorient without causing permanent injury.

**How They Work**: A small canister that, when triggered, produces an intense burst of light and sound designed to overwhelm the senses. The effect is brief but incapacitating.

**Appearance**: A cylinder roughly the size of a fist with a twist-activation mechanism. Lightweight and easy to carry.

### Combat Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Range** | 60 ft (thrown) |
| **Area** | 15 ft radius burst |
| **Effect** | All creatures in radius make DC 13 DEX save |
| **Failed Save** | Blinded and deafened for 1 round |
| **Successful Save** | No effect |
| **Uses** | Single use - consumed on detonation |

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- Flash charges affect everyone in the radius, including allies. Position carefully
- Best used at the start of combat before allies have closed to melee
- Blinded creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls and auto-fail checks requiring sight; attacks against them have advantage
- Deafened creatures cannot hear, which matters for some spells and coordinated enemy responses

**For GMs**:
- Flash charges are excellent for tactical situations - breaching a room, breaking up a brawl, covering a retreat
- Smart enemies who have faced human security before may close their eyes when they see someone reaching for something cylindrical
- The 15 ft radius is significant - it is hard to avoid catching someone you did not intend to

### Limitations

- **Friendly Fire**: Affects all creatures in radius, no targeting
- **Single Use**: Once thrown, it is gone
- **No Damage**: Purely crowd control - will not hurt anyone

### Special Interactions

| Target Type | Effect Modifier |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Dark-adapted humans (Shades) | Disadvantage on save (sensitive to light) |
| Vel'ashi with enhanced senses | Disadvantage on save (sensitive to both light and sound) |
| Creatures in bright sunlight | Advantage on save (contrast is less overwhelming) |
| Night vision goggle users | Automatic failure (the light overloads the amplification) |

### Cultural Note

Flash charges are standard equipment for settlement security teams conducting arrests or responding to disturbances. They are also popular with traders who travel through dangerous territory - a flash charge can buy enough time to escape a bad situation without escalating to lethal force.

Among Vel'ashi, flash charges are viewed with particular distaste. The blinding light is especially disorienting for those with enhanced senses, and many consider it a cowardly weapon. Humans who use flash charges against Vel'ashi may find their reputation suffers in indigenous communities.

## Photosynthetic Supplements

**Original Purpose**: Emergency nutritional support for Photosynthetic humans during extended periods without significant light exposure.

**How They Work**: Photosynthetic humans adapted to need less food by supplementing their nutrition through photosynthesis. In normal conditions, either food or sunlight provides sufficient nutrition. The supplements provide concentrated nutrients and metabolic support that reduces the need for both during emergencies.

**Appearance**: Small capsules or injection vials, typically pale green or amber in color. Shelf life of several years if stored properly.

### Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **When Needed** | After 48+ hours without significant light exposure |
| **Effect** | Extends survival time by 24 hours without food or light |
| **Dosage** | 1 dose per 24-hour period of darkness |
| **Duration of Effect** | 24 hours |
| **Side Effects** | Mild nausea in some users; does not affect non-Photosynthetics |

### Practical Considerations

**Usage Philosophy**: The supplements are emergency supplies, not routine equipment. Most Photosynthetic humans simply avoid extended underground trips or carry sufficient rations. The supplements exist for situations where neither option is available.

**Availability**: Settlement medical facilities stock photosynthetic supplements, but they are not commonly carried by individuals. A Photosynthetic human planning a deep cave expedition might requisition a supply; one making a routine trip would not bother.

**Limitations**: The supplements extend survival, they do not eliminate the need for light entirely. A Photosynthetic human on supplements for more than a week will still experience lethargy and psychological effects from light deprivation. The supplements keep them alive, not comfortable.

### GM Notes

**Plot Device**: Photosynthetic supplements create interesting constraints for party composition. A mixed party with a Photosynthetic member must plan for light availability or carry supplements for extended underground sections.

**Resource Management**: For expeditions into deep caves or other lightless environments, track supplement doses. Running out creates urgency without being immediately lethal.

**NPC Equipment**: Photosynthetic NPCs in underground locations either have supplements, have a light source, or are in trouble. Their presence in such environments is a story element worth noting.

## Cybernetic Maintenance Kit

**Original Purpose**: Essential equipment for Cybernetically Integrated humans (Wired) to maintain their implants and avoid malfunction.

**How They Work**: The kit contains diagnostic tools, cleaning supplies, lubricants, replacement micro-components, and software patches. Regular maintenance keeps implants functioning properly; skipped maintenance risks degradation and failure.

**Appearance**: A reinforced case approximately the size of a large book, containing compartmentalized tools and supplies. The contents are specific to the user's implant types.

### Maintenance Requirements

| Frequency | What Is Done | Time Required |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Weekly | Diagnostic scan, external cleaning, software updates | 30 minutes |
| Monthly | Deep diagnostic, lubrication, minor component replacement | 2 hours |
| Quarterly | Full system check, calibration, component assessment | 4 hours |

### Skipped Maintenance Consequences

When maintenance is skipped, roll on the Malfunction Table at the start of each day:

| d6 | Malfunction |
|----|-------------|
| 1 | **Minor Glitch** - One implant provides -1 to its usual bonus until maintained |
| 2 | **Feedback** - Implant causes 1d4 psychic damage from neural feedback |
| 3 | **Partial Shutdown** - One implant functions at 50% capacity (GM discretion) |
| 4 | **Error State** - Implant provides incorrect information (false sensor reading, etc.) |
| 5 | **Power Drain** - All implants drain power at double rate |
| 6 | **Critical Failure** - One implant shuts down entirely until full maintenance is performed |

**Cumulative Risk**: For each week of skipped maintenance, add +1 to the malfunction roll (maximum 6).

### Kit Contents

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Diagnostic tablet | Runs system checks, identifies issues |
| Micro-tool set | Precision adjustments, minor repairs |
| Cleaning solutions | Prevents contamination and corrosion |
| Synthetic lubricants | Maintains moving components |
| Replacement micro-cells | Power backup for implant batteries |
| Software drive | Patches, updates, calibration data |
| Emergency bypass tools | Temporary fixes for critical failures |

### Cost and Availability

**Initial Kit Cost**: Approximately two months' wages for a skilled worker. Expensive, but essential for the Wired.

**Resupply Costs**: Consumables (lubricants, cleaning solutions, replacement cells) require periodic replacement, costing roughly a week's wages per quarter.

**Specialist Repairs**: Major issues require a cybernetic technician. These specialists are rare outside major settlements and charge accordingly.

### Cultural Note

For the Wired, the maintenance kit is not optional equipment - it is as essential as food and water. "Going clean" (removing implants) is considered shameful, but allowing implants to fail through neglect is considered worse. A Wired human without a maintenance kit is either desperate, foolish, or planning something dangerous.

The kit also represents the Wired's relationship with their technology: it is not simply installed and forgotten, but requires ongoing attention and care. This creates a different relationship with equipment than other human variants experience.

## Medical Facility Equipment

### Portable Medkits

Standard first aid supplies plus a diagnostic scanner that can identify common injuries and illnesses. The scanner's database is limited to human physiology; it provides only basic information about Vel'ashi patients.

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Healing** | Restores 1d4 HP with 10 minutes of treatment |
| **Stabilization** | Can attempt DC 10 Medicine check to stabilize dying creature |
| **Diagnosis** | Advantage on Medicine checks to identify human injuries/diseases |
| **Uses** | 5 uses before resupply needed |
| **Weight** | 2 kg |

### Medstations

Found in settlements, these larger installations can perform surgery, synthesize common medications, and provide long-term care. Access is rationed based on citizenship status.

**Services Available**:
- Full healing (rest equivalent) in 8 hours
- Disease treatment (most common ailments)
- Poison neutralization
- Surgery (injury repair, implant work)
- Long-term care for serious conditions

**Access Requirements**:
- Full citizens: Standard access
- Provisional citizens: Priority queue, may wait
- Non-citizens: Payment required, emergency cases prioritized

### Limitations

- Medical nanomachines exist but are rare and valuable - most humans never receive them
- The equipment cannot interface with Keth'toh's native nanomachine network
- Replacement parts and consumables are carefully tracked by settlement administration
