# Human Defensive Equipment

## Personal Energy Shields

**Original Purpose**: Worker safety equipment designed to protect against industrial accidents - falling debris, equipment malfunctions, explosive decompression.

**How They Work**: A harness worn over clothing projects a partial energy barrier around the wearer. The barrier is not a solid wall but rather a field that rapidly decelerates incoming objects and disperses energy. The system generates heat as it absorbs impacts, requiring careful management during sustained use.

**Power Source**: Integrated power cell with solar charging capability. A full charge provides approximately 48 hours of passive operation.

### Combat Mechanics (Overheat System)

The shield was designed for occasional industrial accidents, not sustained combat. In combat situations, it uses an overheat system:

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Active** | +2 AC while online |
| **Heat Capacity** | 3 points |
| **Heat Generation** | +1 heat each time you are hit while shield is active |
| **Overheat** | At 3 heat, shield goes offline |
| **Cooldown** | 3 rounds offline, then reactivates at 0 heat |
| **Manual Vent** | Bonus action: remove 1 heat, but shield provides no AC bonus that round |
| **Between Encounters** | Resets to 0 heat automatically |
| **Utility Use** | Unlimited outside combat (environmental protection, industrial use) |

**Heat Tracker**: [ ] [ ] [ ]

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- The shield rewards positioning and tactical awareness - avoid getting surrounded
- Manual venting is best used when you have a round to spare (moving, no attacks incoming)
- Three hits and you are exposed for three rounds - know when to retreat
- The shield is excellent for absorbing the first few hits while you assess a threat

**For GMs**:
- Smart enemies may focus fire to force overheat, then press the advantage
- The three-round cooldown creates tension - count it openly
- Environmental heat (fire, lava) could accelerate heat buildup at GM discretion
- The shield still protects against single massive hits - it overheats after, but the wearer survives

### Limitations

- No protection against attacks from behind (the field projects forward and to the sides)
- Sustained pressure (grappling, crushing) bypasses the field entirely
- Cannot be layered with other shield technology
- Limited protection against energy weapons (designed for kinetic impacts)
- Heat buildup in sustained combat

### Utility Applications

Outside combat, energy shields have unlimited practical use:
- Environmental protection (dust storms, minor debris)
- Industrial safety (the original purpose)
- Weather protection in harsh conditions
- Brief exposure to hazardous environments

These applications do not generate combat-level heat because the impacts are minor and sustained rather than sudden and violent.

## Composite Hardshell

**Original Purpose**: Personal armor for security forces and individuals operating in hazardous environments. The hardshell represents the most advanced personal protection humans brought to Keth'toh.

**How They Work**: Layers of synthetic composite materials absorb and distribute impact force. The outer shell is treated to resist energy weapon damage, while inner layers provide structural support and limited flexibility. The result is armor that is lighter than equivalent metal protection but requires specialized maintenance.

**Appearance**: Segmented plates covering torso, shoulders, and upper arms. Typically grey or dark blue. The material has a slightly textured surface that does not reflect light.

### Combat Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Base AC** | 14 + DEX modifier (max +2) |
| **Type** | Medium armor |
| **Stealth** | No disadvantage |
| **Weight** | 7 kg |
| **Compatibility** | Stacks with energy shield (+2 AC when shield is active) |

### Integrity System (Degradation)

Composite hardshell degrades with use. Unlike metal armor that can be hammered back into shape, the synthetic materials permanently deform under stress.

| Integrity | AC Modifier | Condition |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 10 | Base AC (14 + DEX) | Pristine |
| 7-9 | Base AC (14 + DEX) | Standard wear |
| 4-6 | -1 AC (13 + DEX) | Worn - visible stress marks |
| 1-3 | -2 AC (12 + DEX) | Damaged - cracked plates, exposed layers |
| 0 | Destroyed | Armor provides no protection |

**Integrity Tracker**: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

**Damage Rules**:
- After any combat where the wearer took damage, the armor loses 1 Integrity
- Critical hits that deal damage cause an additional 1 Integrity loss
- Environmental hazards (acid, extreme heat) may cause Integrity loss at GM discretion

**Repair Rules**:
- A specialist with proper equipment can restore Integrity
- Each repair cycle permanently reduces maximum Integrity by 1
- A suit repaired once has max Integrity 9; repaired twice, max 8; and so on
- Suits cannot be repaired past their current maximum
- When maximum Integrity reaches 5, most specialists recommend retirement

### NPC Armor Tiers (GM Guidance)

Most human NPCs will not have pristine equipment. Use this table for quick reference:

| Tier | Integrity | Effective AC | Who Has It |
|------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Worn | 4-6 | 12-13 + DEX (max 2) | Most mercenaries, old equipment, common NPCs |
| Standard | 7-9 | 14 + DEX (max 2) | Elite guards, recent issue, well-funded groups |
| Pristine | 10 | 14 + DEX (max 2) | Commanders, bosses, brand new equipment |

**GM Note**: Default to Worn for most human NPCs. Pristine gear is expensive and rare - only leadership or well-funded operations (like Third Anchor security commanders) would have Standard or Pristine equipment. Finding pristine hardshell on a random traveler should raise questions about who they are and where they got it.

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- The hardshell is excellent medium armor that does not penalize stealth
- Combined with an energy shield, you can achieve AC 18+ (14 base + 2 DEX + 2 shield) - very respectable
- Track your Integrity. A hardshell that drops to 4 Integrity has functionally lost 1 AC
- Consider avoiding unnecessary combats to preserve armor condition
- Repair costs and maximum Integrity loss mean the armor has a finite lifespan

**For GMs**:
- Integrity creates interesting resource management without being onerous
- The repair ceiling means even wealthy characters eventually need replacement
- NPC armor condition tells a story - worn armor suggests a long career or hard times; pristine armor suggests resources and recent issue
- Looted hardshell is valuable but may already be damaged

### Limitations

- **DEX Cap**: Maximum +2 from Dexterity
- **Degradation**: Loses effectiveness over time and use
- **Repair Ceiling**: Cannot be maintained indefinitely
- **Specialist Required**: Field repairs are not possible; requires proper facilities

### Cultural Note

Composite hardshell is a status symbol among humans who operate outside settlements. Pristine armor marks someone as either well-connected, recently equipped by an organization, or successful enough to afford replacement. Worn armor marks a survivor - someone who has been through enough to degrade their equipment and is still standing.

Among Vel'ashi, hardshell is recognized as serious protection. Warriors who have faced armored humans know that conventional weapons struggle against the material, which contributes to the wariness many Vel'ashi feel toward armed humans.
