# Human Utility Equipment

## Magnetic Binders

**Original Purpose**: Security restraints for detaining suspects without causing injury. Designed to be effective, reusable, and difficult to escape.

**How They Work**: Two cuffs connected by a flexible cable contain powerful electromagnets that lock when activated. The magnetic seal creates a bond stronger than physical locks - there is no keyhole to pick, no mechanism to break. Deactivation requires a paired controller or override code.

**Power Source**: Internal micro-cell provides approximately 72 hours of continuous lock. Low-power indicator warns when charge drops below 20%.

### Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Escape DC (STR)** | DC 18 - brute force against the magnetic seal |
| **Escape DC (DEX)** | DC 20 - slipping free requires extremely small wrists or dislocating joints |
| **Plasma Cutter** | Can cut through the cable or cuffs, but requires 3 rounds and risks burning the restrained person (DEX save DC 12 or 1d6 fire damage) |
| **EMP/Power Drain** | Electromagnetic disruption releases the lock instantly |
| **Controller Range** | 30 feet for remote unlock |
| **Weight** | 1 lb |

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- Magnetic binders are excellent for taking prisoners without killing them
- The high escape DCs mean most humanoids cannot break free unassisted
- Cutting binders off an ally is risky but possible - position carefully
- If captured, look for electromagnetic interference or find someone with a plasma cutter

**For GMs**:
- Security forces carry binders as standard equipment
- The DC 18/20 escape DCs mean escape requires exceptional strength, assistance, or creative thinking
- Power drain is a potential weak point - Cybernetically Integrated humans or characters with relevant abilities might exploit this
- The 72-hour battery life means time pressure if prisoners cannot be transported quickly

### Limitations

- **Humanoid Only**: Designed for human proportions; may not fit Vel'ashi in non-humanoid forms
- **Power Dependent**: Eventually releases if power runs out
- **Controller Required**: Without the paired controller, release requires cutting or power disruption
- **Heat Vulnerability**: The cable can be cut with sufficient heat (plasma cutter, sustained fire)

### Cultural Note

Magnetic binders represent the human approach to law enforcement - non-lethal restraint, with release controlled by authority. The technology reinforces settlement hierarchy: those with controllers have power over those without.

Among Vel'ashi, magnetic binders are viewed as unnecessarily complicated. Most Vel'ashi would simply bind a prisoner with rope or vines - but rope cannot resist a Vel'ashi who shifts into a smaller form.

## Night Vision Goggles

**Original Purpose**: Equipment for baseline and Photosynthetic humans operating in darkness, originally designed for mining and underground exploration.

**How They Work**: The goggles amplify ambient light and translate low-frequency electromagnetic radiation into visible images. The display projects directly onto the user's eyes, providing a monochrome green view of the surrounding environment.

**Power Source**: Standard power cell provides 8 hours of continuous use. Extended use causes mild headaches in some users.

### Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Darkvision** | Grants darkvision 60 feet while worn |
| **Precision Penalty** | -2 to DEX checks requiring precise movement (lockpicking, surgery, etc.) |
| **Peripheral Vision** | Disadvantage on Perception checks to notice threats from the sides |
| **Weight** | 1 lb |
| **Activation** | Free action to toggle on/off |

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- Night vision goggles let non-Dark-adapted humans operate underground or at night
- The precision penalty matters for delicate work - remove them for fine manipulation
- Watch your flanks. The restricted peripheral vision is a real vulnerability
- In mixed-light environments, toggle them off when you have natural light

**For GMs**:
- NPCs with night vision are still vulnerable to flanking and ambush
- The goggles create interesting party dynamics - who has them, who does not
- Bright light (flash charges, sudden torchlight) temporarily blinds goggle users (1 round, no save)
- Power drain is relevant for extended underground expeditions

### Limitations

- **Restricted Field of View**: Tunnel vision effect reduces awareness
- **Precision Work**: Penalty on fine motor tasks
- **Light Sensitivity**: Sudden bright light is blinding while wearing active goggles
- **Power Consumption**: 8 hours per cell is manageable but requires planning

### Cultural Note

Night vision goggles are common equipment for humans who work outside settlements, particularly in the cave systems and forests of Keth'toh. Dark-adapted humans (Shades) find the technology amusing - why would you need a device to see in the dark?

The goggles are one item that occasionally makes it into Vel'ashi hands through trade. Some Vel'ashi find them useful for scouting human settlements at night, though most prefer to simply shift forms with better natural vision.

## Portable Scanner

**Original Purpose**: Field investigation and survey equipment for research teams, security patrols, and explorers. A miniaturized version of settlement research equipment.

**How They Work**: The scanner emits low-power electromagnetic pulses and analyzes the return signals to detect motion, body heat, material composition, and energy signatures. Results display on a small screen or can be projected as a heads-up overlay.

**Power Source**: Standard power cell provides 4 hours of active scanning. Passive mode (motion detection only) extends battery life to 24 hours.

### Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Investigation Bonus** | +2 to Investigation checks to detect hidden objects, compartments, or mechanisms |
| **Perception Bonus** | +2 to Perception checks to detect hidden or invisible creatures |
| **Motion Detection Mode** | Passive alert when movement occurs within 30 feet; no bonus to checks |
| **Deep Scan Mode** | Full analysis requires 1 minute; reveals material composition, energy signatures, recent movement |
| **Range** | 60 feet for standard scan, 30 feet for motion detection |
| **Weight** | 2 lbs |

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- The scanner is invaluable for clearing rooms, detecting ambushes, and finding hidden doors
- Motion detection mode is excellent for watch duty - set it and let it alert you
- Deep scan takes time but reveals details visual inspection would miss
- The +2 bonuses are reliable and stack with other advantages

**For GMs**:
- Scanners change the dynamic of hidden enemies and traps - use them as intended
- Some creatures might not register clearly (incorporeal, heavily shielded, or disguised)
- The 60-foot range means large spaces still require methodical scanning
- Power management becomes relevant in extended dungeons or expeditions

### Limitations

- **Power Consumption**: Active scanning drains batteries quickly
- **Processing Time**: Deep scans require patience
- **Countermeasures**: Shielding, certain materials, or unusual life signs may produce false readings
- **Not Infallible**: The scanner detects what its sensors can perceive - it is not magic

### Cultural Note

Portable scanners are prized equipment among human explorers and investigators. A working scanner is the difference between walking into an ambush and seeing it coming. Settlement security forces carry them for patrol work; research teams use them for surveys.

The Keth'vorah has acquired several human scanners and studied them extensively. They have not shared their findings, but the technology clearly interests them - particularly its ability to detect things that should not be detectable.

## Dark-Adapted Visors

**Original Purpose**: Protective eyewear for Dark-adapted humans (Shades) who must operate in daylight conditions.

**How They Work**: The visors use photochromic materials that automatically adjust their opacity based on ambient light levels. In bright light, they darken to near-opacity; in dim light, they become nearly transparent. The adjustment is nearly instantaneous, protecting the wearer's sensitive eyes from sudden light changes.

**Power Source**: None - the photochromic materials are passive.

### Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Light Protection** | Removes the disadvantage on attack rolls and Perception checks that Dark-adapted humans suffer in bright light |
| **Perception Penalty** | -1 to all Perception checks (reduced peripheral vision from the frame design) |
| **Transition Speed** | Adjusts to changing light within 1 round |
| **Weight** | Negligible |
| **Durability** | Reasonably sturdy but can be broken (AC 13, 1 HP) |

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- Dark-Adapted Visors are essential equipment for any Shade who travels on the surface
- The -1 Perception penalty is much better than full disadvantage in bright light
- Keep a spare pair. Losing your visors in combat could be disabling
- The visors do not help with the cultural discomfort many Shades feel in bright environments

**For GMs**:
- Targeting a Shade's visors is a valid (if unsporting) combat tactic
- The visors represent the adaptation challenges Dark-adapted humans face
- A Shade without visors in daylight is significantly impaired - this creates tension and stakes
- The -1 penalty is minor but can matter on close checks

### Limitations

- **Physical Vulnerability**: Can be knocked off or broken
- **Perception Penalty**: The protective frame limits peripheral vision
- **Cultural**: Some traditionalist Shades consider visors a sign of weakness - "real" Deepfolk should not need to go into the light
- **Not Perfect**: Even with visors, bright light environments are uncomfortable for prolonged periods

### Cultural Note

Dark-adapted Visors are standard equipment in human settlements with mixed populations. They represent a practical solution to variant coexistence - Shades can work alongside Photosynthetics and baseline humans without significant impairment.

Among the Deepfolk communities that live entirely underground, visors are viewed with some suspicion. "Surface gear," they call it - equipment for those who have abandoned the proper way of life. A Shade carrying visors is immediately marked as someone who spends time above ground, for good or ill.

## Lighting Equipment

### Flashlights

Standard rechargeable units in various sizes. Photosynthetic humans often carry high-output models that can serve as supplementary "feeding" during extended underground travel.

| Type | Range | Duration | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|-------|
| Pocket light | 30 ft bright, 30 ft dim | 12 hours | Fits in palm, emergency backup |
| Standard | 60 ft bright, 60 ft dim | 8 hours | Common issue, belt-mounted |
| High-output | 120 ft bright, 60 ft dim | 4 hours | For Photosynthetics, security, exploration |

### Flares

Chemical light sources that do not require power. Limited supply, as the chemicals cannot be manufactured locally.

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Duration** | 1 hour |
| **Range** | 20 ft bright light, 20 ft dim light |
| **Uses** | Signaling, emergency lighting, marking paths |
| **Availability** | Uncommon - rationed in settlements |

### Glow Panels

Flat panels that provide ambient light for living spaces. Most human dwellings are lit this way. Not portable in any practical sense.

## Tool Kits

### Maintenance Kits

Standardized sets for repairing common equipment. Every human is expected to perform basic maintenance on their own gear.

| Kit Type | Contains | Weight |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Personal | Basic tools, cleaning supplies, common spare parts | 1 kg |
| Technical | Diagnostic equipment, specialized tools, wider spare parts selection | 3.5 kg |
| Field Repair | Improvised repair materials, adhesives, emergency patches | 2 kg |

### Fabrication Units

Rare devices that can manufacture simple parts from raw materials. Controlled by settlement administration and available only for approved repairs. Not portable equipment - these are facility-scale machines.
