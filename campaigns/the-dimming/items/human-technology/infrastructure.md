# Human Infrastructure and Economy

## Ground Vehicles

Ground vehicles exist on Keth'toh but are impractical for adventure use.

### Why Vehicles Are Rare

**Fuel/Power Scarcity**: Vehicle-grade power cells are expensive to maintain and recharge. A single trip between settlements can consume resources equivalent to a month's wages.

**No Road Network**: Outside settlements, Keth'toh has no roads designed for vehicles. The terrain is rough, vegetation is dense, and the distances between human-inhabited areas were never developed with wheeled transport in mind.

**Maintenance Burden**: Vehicles require specialized maintenance that most travelers cannot perform. A breakdown in the wilderness means abandoning the vehicle.

### Where Vehicles Operate

**Within Settlements**: Third Anchor and First Anchor have internal vehicle networks for cargo transport and emergency services. These are practical within the developed areas.

**Immediate Vicinity**: Vehicles can operate in cleared areas around settlements - farms, landing fields, mining sites. Range is limited to a few kilometers before terrain becomes impassable.

### The Train System

**First Anchor to Third Anchor Route**: A preserved rail line connects the two major human settlements. The journey takes approximately 8 hours.

| Property | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Frequency** | Twice weekly in each direction |
| **Capacity** | Passenger cars, cargo cars |
| **Cost** | Significant - roughly a week's wages for a passenger ticket |
| **Security** | Settlement security maintains presence on trains |
| **Stops** | Direct route, no intermediate stations |

**Other Routes**: Several smaller settlements have rail connections, though service is less frequent. The rail network represents the limit of human infrastructure expansion.

### GM Note

Vehicles are background worldbuilding, not player equipment. If players ask about vehicles:
- Within settlements: Available for hire, expensive
- Between settlements: Train is the only reliable option
- Cross-country: Not practical; travel is on foot or by beast

The lack of vehicle infrastructure reinforces that humans are a small presence on a large, wild world.

## Currency System

### Human Credits

The primary currency within human settlements is the **digital credit**, tracked through personal accounts linked to citizenship status.

| Transaction Type | Typical Credits |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Day's unskilled labor | 10-15 credits |
| Day's skilled labor | 25-50 credits |
| Simple meal | 2-3 credits |
| Night's lodging (basic) | 5-10 credits |
| Trauma injector | 150-200 credits |
| Pulse carbine (if available) | 1,000+ credits |

### Exchange Rate with Traditional Currency

For convenience when converting between campaign economies:

| Currency | Exchange Rate |
|----------|---------------|
| 1 gold piece | 50 credits |
| 1 silver piece | 5 credits |
| 1 copper piece | 0.5 credits |

### Where Different Systems Apply

**Settlements (Third Anchor, First Anchor)**: Credits are standard. Most transactions are digital. Physical currency is unusual but not unknown.

**Trading Posts (Dustmeet, etc.)**: Mixed economy. Credits accepted from humans with verified accounts; barter common; some physical currency circulates.

**Vel'ashi Territory**: Barter-based. Vel'ashi do not use credits and generally do not understand or care about the human monetary system. Trade is based on perceived value of goods exchanged.

### Citizenship and Credits

Credit accounts are tied to citizenship status:
- **Full Citizens**: Full access to credit system, can receive wages, make purchases
- **Provisional Citizens**: Limited credit access, may face transaction caps
- **Non-Citizens**: No credit access; must use barter or physical currency

This creates a two-tier economy where citizenship determines financial access.

## Power Systems

### Power Cells

The universal power source for human equipment. Standardized centuries ago on the colony ships, power cells are rechargeable units that can be swapped between compatible devices.

**Charging Methods**:
- Solar panels (slow but reliable)
- Settlement power grid (fastest)
- Manual generators (emergency backup)
- Thermal differential units (for underground use)

**Lifespan**: A well-maintained power cell can last decades before degradation affects performance. When cells fail, they are recycled - the materials are too valuable to waste.

### The Settlement Grid

Third Anchor and First Anchor maintain power generation facilities that provide electricity to residents. The specifics vary - Third Anchor uses a combination of solar and geothermal, while First Anchor relies primarily on a preserved fusion plant from the colony ships.

Access to grid power is a privilege of settlement citizenship. Travelers and those who live outside the settlements must rely on portable power sources.

### Power Cell Economy

| Cell Type | Capacity | Typical Use | Cost |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------|
| Micro-cell | 1 day | Small devices, implants | 5 credits |
| Standard cell | 1 week | Personal equipment | 25 credits |
| Heavy cell | 2 weeks | Weapons, shields, scanners | 75 credits |
| Vehicle cell | Varies | Ground vehicles | 500+ credits |

Charging is free for citizens with grid access; traders and outposts charge 10-20% of cell value for a full charge.

## Communicators

### Types Available

**Personal Units**: Handheld devices with limited range (approximately 20 kilometers in open terrain, less in caves or dense forest). Standard issue for settlement residents.

**Relay Units**: Larger devices that can boost signal range by connecting to the settlement communication network. Fixed installations in human territory.

**Long-Range Units**: Rare and valuable, capable of reaching any human settlement on Keth'toh. Typically owned by research teams, traders, or high-ranking officials.

### Limitations

- Human communication networks do not extend into Vel'ashi territory
- Nanomachine interference can disrupt signals in certain areas (humans blame "atmospheric conditions")
- Most units are decades old and require careful maintenance
- Encryption is standard, but the Keth'vorah are rumored to have ways of listening

## Water Purification

Water treatment is a solved problem for humans on Keth'toh, though the solutions vary by context.

### Settlement Systems

Third Anchor and First Anchor have built-in water treatment facilities that provide safe drinking water to residents. The systems filter, sterilize, and monitor water quality automatically.

### Portable Purification

Travelers carry basic purification equipment:

| Method | Capacity | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Purification tablets | 10 liters per tablet | Slow (30 minutes), bitter taste |
| Filter straw | Indefinite (needs cleaning) | Immediate use, personal only |
| Portable filter | 100 liters per cartridge | Fastest for groups, bulky |

### Water Safety on Keth'toh

Keth'toh's water is generally safe for human consumption:
- Most rivers and streams are drinkable with minimal treatment
- Some regions have contamination (mineral content, biological agents)
- Vel'ashi sources are typically safe (they drink the same water)

**Standard Practice**: Every traveler's kit includes basic purification. It is not that the water is dangerous - it is that the one time it is, you want to be prepared.

### GM Note

Water purification is not intended as a significant gameplay element. It exists to establish that humans thought about survival infrastructure. Unless there is a specific plot reason (contaminated zone, siege situation, poisoning attempt), assume clean water is available with minimal effort.

## Maintenance Requirements

### Standard Maintenance Schedule

All human technology requires periodic maintenance to remain functional:

| Equipment | Maintenance Interval | What Is Required |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Plasma Cutter | Weekly | Electrode cleaning, magnetic field calibration |
| Energy Shield | Monthly | Projector alignment, power cell inspection, heat sink cleaning |
| Communicator | Quarterly | Software updates (when available), antenna maintenance |
| Medical Scanner | Annually | Database verification, sensor calibration |
| Pulse Carbine | Monthly | Magnetic rail cleaning, power cell contact inspection |
| Stun Baton | Quarterly | Electrode inspection, charge calibration |
| Trauma Injector | N/A | Single-use, no maintenance (check expiration on compounds) |
| Flash Charge | N/A | Single-use, no maintenance (check seal integrity) |
| Composite Hardshell | After damage | Integrity assessment, specialist repair if needed |
| Portable Scanner | Monthly | Sensor calibration, software updates |
| Night Vision Goggles | Quarterly | Lens cleaning, amplifier calibration |
| Magnetic Binders | Quarterly | Magnetic seal test, power cell check |

### Parts Availability

**Common Parts**: Available in settlements, can sometimes be found at trading posts like Dustmeet. Basic maintenance supplies are tradeable goods.

**Rare Parts**: Must be fabricated at settlement facilities or salvaged from non-functional equipment. Wait times can be months.

**Irreplaceable Parts**: Some equipment contains components that cannot be manufactured or repaired. When these fail, the device becomes scrap.

### Field Repairs

Humans who travel outside settlements learn to perform emergency repairs with limited resources. Improvised fixes are common but rarely last long. A skilled technician can keep equipment running far beyond its expected lifespan, making such individuals valuable companions for any expedition.
