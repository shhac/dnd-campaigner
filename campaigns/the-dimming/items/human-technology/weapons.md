# Human Weapons

## Plasma Cutters

**Original Purpose**: Industrial cutting tools for construction, mining, and salvage work. Designed to slice through metal, stone, and structural materials efficiently.

**How They Work**: A focused plasma arc is generated between two electrodes at the tip of the tool, creating a blade-like cutting surface. The plasma is contained within a magnetic field that gives it approximately 45 cm of cutting edge - enough for industrial work, awkward for combat.

**Power Source**: Rechargeable power cells, standardized across human equipment. A fully charged cell provides approximately 8 hours of active cutting use, or much longer if used only intermittently.

### Combat Use

The plasma cutter was never designed as a weapon. It has no guard, the balance is optimized for controlled cutting rather than combat maneuvers, and the blade length is fixed at whatever worked best for industrial applications. That said, it is still a 45 cm plasma blade - it will absolutely hurt someone.

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Damage** | 1d8 + STR modifier fire damage |
| **Attack** | Standard melee weapon attack |
| **Properties** | No special combat mechanics - it is a tool, not a sword |

### Utility Applications (Where It Shines)

This is what the plasma cutter is actually for:

| Application | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Cutting Materials** | Automatically cuts through non-magical materials up to 5 cm thick, given sufficient time |
| **Locks, Bars, Restraints** | Advantage on any check to cut through locks, chains, bars, or other restraints |
| **Object Hardness** | Ignores object hardness when cutting - plasma does not care how hard the metal is |
| **Breaching Walls** | Cut a person-sized hole in a standard wall in approximately 1 minute |
| **Quick Cuts** | Slice through a padlock or chain in a single round (6 seconds) |

The plasma cutter turns many "how do we get through this barrier?" problems into "how long do we have?" problems. Locked door? Give it 30 seconds. Cell bars? Same. Cargo container? A few minutes. The question is not whether the cutter can get through - it almost certainly can - but whether you have time before something interrupts you.

### Limitations

- **Not a Weapon**: No guard, awkward balance, fixed blade length - functional in combat but not optimized for it
- **Water**: Cannot be used underwater or in heavy rain (plasma arc destabilizes)
- **Noise**: Makes a distinctive humming sound that Vel'ashi find unpleasant
- **Light & Heat**: Produces significant heat and light when active - stealth is not an option
- **Maintenance**: Requires periodic electrode replacement (every few months with regular use)
- **Power**: Requires power cells (standard human tech cells)

### Cultural Note

Humans who carry plasma cutters openly are making a statement. The tool is associated with workers - miners, builders, salvagers - and carrying one advertises either practical skills or a willingness to fight. Settlement security forces use standardized models; independent travelers often use older or modified versions.

### GM Notes

The plasma cutter is excellent for problem-solving scenarios:
- Locked in a cell? They can cut their way out, but it takes time and makes noise
- Barricaded door? Same solution, same tradeoffs
- Need to breach a wall quietly? Wrong tool for the job
- Chase scene with a locked gate? Can they buy 6 seconds?

Lean into the "industrial tool, not weapon" angle. It is reliable and effective at what it does, but that thing is not for fighting - it is for cutting. When someone pulls a plasma cutter in combat, they are improvising. When they pull it to cut through a locked cargo bay door, they are using the right tool for the job.

## Pulse Carbine

**Original Purpose**: A dedicated ranged weapon, unlike most human equipment which was repurposed from industrial tools. Pulse carbines were standard security issue on the colony ships and remain the primary ranged weapon for settlement defense forces.

**How They Work**: The carbine accelerates a small plasma charge to high velocity, creating a bolt of superheated matter that impacts the target. The weapon uses magnetic acceleration rather than chemical propellants, making it quiet compared to firearms but still producing a distinctive "snap-hiss" when fired.

**Power Source**: Standard power cells configured as magazines. Each cell provides 20 shots before requiring replacement. Spent cells can be recharged at any standard charging station.

### Combat Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Damage** | 1d6 energy damage |
| **Range** | 80/320 ft |
| **Ammunition** | Power cells (20 shots per cell) |
| **Properties** | Light, requires two hands to fire |

### Rapid Fire (Overheat Mechanic)

The carbine can sustain a higher rate of fire than its cooling system was designed for:

| Situation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Normal Fire** | One attack per turn, no penalty |
| **Rapid Fire** | Can fire twice in one turn (with Extra Attack or similar feature) |
| **Overheat** | If you fire twice in one turn, the weapon overheats and cannot fire the following turn |

**Tactical Note**: Rapid fire is a burst-and-recover decision. You can deal extra damage now but sacrifice your next turn's ranged option. Plan accordingly - do not overheat when enemies are closing to melee.

### Penetration Rules (Key Feature)

The pulse carbine's energy bolts interact differently with different types of protection. This is the primary reason humans maintain technological superiority despite being vastly outnumbered.

**Against Primitive/Natural Protection:**

| Target Protection | Penetration Effect |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Wood, leather, hide | Half cover is ignored entirely |
| Natural cover (trees, brush) | Half cover is ignored entirely |
| Three-quarters cover (primitive) | Treated as half cover instead |
| Metal armor (chain, plate, scale) | Target's AC from armor reduced by 2 (energy burns through and heats the metal) |
| Unarmored/natural armor | No special effect, normal damage |

**Against Modern Human Technology:**

| Target Protection | Penetration Effect |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Personal Energy Shield | No penetration bonus (designed to disperse energy) |
| Composite Hardshell | No penetration bonus (energy-resistant materials) |
| Modern barriers/cover | Normal cover rules apply |

**Example Scenarios:**

- Vel'ashi warrior in leather armor behind a wooden cart: The cart provides no cover, and their leather provides reduced protection. Effective AC penalty of -2 to -4 depending on how much protection came from the leather.
- Human security officer with energy shield and hardshell: Full protection, no penetration bonus. The technology was designed with energy weapons in mind.
- Vel'ashi behind stone wall (three-quarters cover): Treated as half cover instead. Stone is not designed to stop energy weapons.

### Cultural Significance

The pulse carbine's penetration advantage is why Vel'ashi are wary of humans despite outnumbering them significantly. A single human with a carbine and good positioning can hold off multiple Vel'ashi warriors, as their traditional protections offer limited defense against energy weapons.

This disparity is also why humans maintain strict technology-sharing policies. If pulse carbines became widespread among Vel'ashi factions, humans would lose their primary defensive advantage. Settlement administrations track carbines carefully - every weapon has a serial number and registered owner.

### GM Notes

The penetration rules create interesting tactical situations:

- **Mixed Enemy Groups**: If humans face both Vel'ashi and other humans, their carbines are much more effective against the Vel'ashi. This can create moral complexity when the "easy" targets are indigenous people.
- **Cover Considerations**: Vel'ashi who understand human weapons will seek modern human cover or thick stone rather than wood or natural terrain.
- **Loot Value**: A captured carbine is extremely valuable to Vel'ashi factions, creating potential plot hooks around weapon theft or black market deals.
- **Ammunition Tracking**: 20 shots per cell is generous for most encounters but becomes relevant in extended conflicts or when resupply is uncertain.

**For balance**: The penetration bonus is significant but not overwhelming. A Vel'ashi warrior with 16 AC (12 base + 4 from leather) becomes AC 14 - meaningful, but not helpless. The advantage is most pronounced against groups using extensive cover.

## Stun Baton

**Original Purpose**: Security and crowd control equipment for settlement law enforcement. Designed to incapacitate without killing - valuable when every human life represents irreplaceable population.

**How They Work**: The baton generates a localized electrical discharge on contact, disrupting the target's nervous system. The charge is calibrated for human physiology but affects Vel'ashi similarly (their nervous systems, while different, are still susceptible to electrical disruption).

**Power Source**: Integrated rechargeable cell. The baton can be used as a standard club when depleted.

### Combat Mechanics

| Property | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Damage** | 1d6 bludgeoning damage |
| **Stun Effect** | On hit, target makes DC 12 CON save or is stunned until the end of their next turn |
| **Charges** | 6 charges per encounter |
| **Depleted** | When charges are expended, functions as a club (1d4 bludgeoning, no stun) |
| **Recharge** | Automatically recharges between encounters (assumes access to any power source) |

### Tactical Considerations

**For Players**:
- The stun effect is powerful - a stunned target automatically fails STR and DEX saves, attacks against them have advantage, and they cannot take actions or reactions
- Use charges strategically. Six stuns per encounter is generous, but you do not want to run dry at a critical moment
- Works on both humans and Vel'ashi equally - useful for non-lethal resolution
- The DC 12 CON save is moderate - tough enemies may shake it off, but average targets will often fail

**For GMs**:
- Settlement security almost always carries stun batons. Lethal force is discouraged except in dire circumstances
- The stun baton represents human society's emphasis on preserving life - even criminals are too valuable to kill casually
- Vel'ashi who acquire stun batons often find them puzzling. Why would you want to *not* kill an enemy?

### Limitations

- **Range**: Melee only - you have to close distance to use it
- **Charges**: Limited stuns per encounter
- **CON Save**: High-constitution targets resist the effect
- **No Damage Bonus**: The baton's damage is modest; its value is the stun, not the hit

### Cultural Note

The stun baton is standard issue for Third Anchor security patrols and is commonly seen throughout human settlements. Its presence is a reminder of human society's internal tensions - the baton is for controlling other humans as much as defending against external threats. Settlement disputes, rationing enforcement, citizenship violations - the stun baton handles them all without permanent consequences.
