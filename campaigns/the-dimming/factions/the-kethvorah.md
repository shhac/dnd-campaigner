# The Keth'vorah

**Type**: Ancient Scholarly Order
**Influence**: Regional (among Vel'ashi), Unknown (among humans)
**Campaign**: The Dimming

## Overview

The Keth'vorah are keepers of what remains. Founded in the generations after the Collapse, they preserve artifacts, maintain certain technologies, and guard knowledge that would be dangerous if widely known. They are scholars, but also protectors - and sometimes suppressors of truth.

## Goals

**Public Goal**: Preserve pre-Collapse knowledge and artifacts for the benefit of all Vel'ashi
**True Goal**: Control what is known and what is forgotten. Some truths are too dangerous. They guard not just knowledge, but ignorance.

## Methods

- Operate through investigators who travel to sites of interest
- Maintain hidden archives and caches throughout Keth'toh
- Advise local councils without claiming political power
- Occasionally "retire" artifacts or texts deemed too dangerous
- Secretly consult with humans on matters of shared concern

## Structure

**Leadership**: The Three Silences - elders who have given up their names for their roles. They rarely appear in public.
**Hierarchy**: Investigators (field operatives), Archivists (scholars), Wardens (guards), Initiates (students)
**Membership**: Perhaps two hundred total, scattered across Keth'toh. Recruitment is by invitation only.

## Resources

- **Wealth**: Moderate - they have what they need but do not seek more
- **Military**: Limited - Wardens are trained but few in number
- **Magic**: Significant - they control more working artifacts than any other faction
- **Political**: Some - their advice is respected, but they hold no formal power

## Key Members

| Name | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| The First Silence | Elder | Focuses on artifacts and technology |
| The Second Silence | Elder | Focuses on history and archives |
| The Third Silence | Elder | Focuses on external relations, including humans |
| Nethara'kora | Investigator | Deceased, gave the party the Eth'koru |
| Ashkaleth'mora | Senior Investigator | Likely to be sent to recover the Eth'koru |
| Korimeth | Initiate | Nethara'kora's student; now traveling with the party |

## Symbols & Recognition

**Symbol**: A closed eye within an open hand - representing protected knowledge
**Colors**: Deep blue and silver
**Recognition Signs**: Specific phrases exchanged in greeting, subtle hand positions, certain archaic words that mark a speaker as initiated

## Relationship to Party

**Current Standing**: Unknown - the party has their artifact but no formal relationship
**History**: Nethara'kora gave them the Eth'koru and her mission

## Relationship to Other Factions

| Faction | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| Dustmeet Council | Respectful distance - the Keth'vorah help but don't interfere |
| Human Settlers | Secret consultation with select humans; officially no contact |
| Research Collective | No formal relationship; deeply concerned about their activities |

## Hooks & Opportunities

- The Keth'vorah will want to know what happened to Nethara'kora
- They may try to reclaim the Eth'koru - or deputize the party to continue her mission
- Internal factions disagree on how to handle the human threat
- Their archives may contain crucial information about the nanomachine network
- An alliance could provide resources, information, and legitimacy

## GM Notes

The Keth'vorah are complicated allies. They have the best understanding of pre-Collapse technology, but they've also suppressed knowledge they deemed dangerous. They didn't tell the general population that "magic" is technology. They've hidden truths about what the Vel'ashi used to be.

Their likely response to Nethara'kora's death:
1. Send an envoy (probably Ashkaleth'mora) to investigate
2. Attempt to recover the Eth'koru
3. Assess whether the party is useful or a liability
4. Either recruit them, buy them off, or neutralize them

Internal conflict within the Keth'vorah:
- Some want to confront the humans directly
- Some want to continue secret diplomacy
- Some think the party should be eliminated as loose ends
- A few radical members believe the truth should be revealed to all Vel'ashi

The party's relationship with the Keth'vorah will shape how they learn the truth about Keth'toh. If allied, the order can be a source of exposition and resources. If opposed, they become an additional complication.

The Keth'vorah know what the nanomachines are. They know what the Collapse was. They've chosen to keep this knowledge secret because they believe the Vel'ashi are better off not knowing how much they've lost.
