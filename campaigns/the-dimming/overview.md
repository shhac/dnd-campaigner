# The Dimming

## Setting

**World**: Keth'toh (native name) / Chalawan-II (human designation)
**Era/Time Period**: Post-Collapse - thousands of years after an ancient catastrophe, with technology slowly decaying (the Collapse predates human contact by millennia)
**Starting Location**: Dustmeet, a native-run trading post half a day south of Third Anchor, at the crossroads of three ancient paths

## Species & Ecology Reference

## Tone & Themes

**Tone**: Mystery and melancholy with moments of wonder - a world slowly forgetting itself
**Core Themes**:
- Lost identity and the burden of forgotten history
- The price of knowledge vs. the comfort of ignorance
- Coexistence between vastly different peoples
- Technology as magic, and the consequences of treating it as such

## The Hook

An ancient artifact has awakened - a palm-sized orb of dark metal that pulses with inner light, responding to something only it can sense. It functions as a compass, its needle-like beam pointing toward locations of significance that its bearers cannot yet understand.

The artifact was brought to Dustmeet by Nethara'kora, a respected investigator of the Keth'vorah, the ancient order that preserves what remains of pre-Collapse knowledge. She arrived wounded, fevered, speaking of "the Dimming" - a threat she claimed would end everything the Vel'ashi have become. Before she could explain, she died, but not before pressing the artifact into the hands of those nearby and whispering: "Follow where it leads. Stop them. The old dark is returning."

## Major Factions

### The Keth'vorah
- **Type**: Ancient scholarly order (Vel'ashi)
- **Goals**: Preserve pre-Collapse knowledge, maintain certain technologies, control dangerous relics
- **Relationship to Party**: Cautious allies - the party carries one of their investigator's final mission

### Human Research Team (Second Anchor)
- **Type**: Secret research operation in abandoned settlement
- **Goals**: Understand and neutralize what they see as dangerous alien technology
- **Relationship to Party**: Unknown (but secretly the source of the threat)

### The Dustmeet Council
- **Type**: Local governing body (Vel'ashi-led, humans tolerated)
- **Goals**: Maintain peace and profitable trade at the crossroads
- **Relationship to Party**: Neutral - wants no trouble, but won't obstruct honest travelers

## Key Locations

### Dustmeet
A trading post where paths between settlements converge. Built from salvaged materials and living structures, it serves as neutral ground where Vel'ashi and humans can trade without territorial complications. The architecture shifts subtly - walls that were corners become curves, colors change with the light.

### Third Anchor
The third and largest human settlement on Keth'toh, serving as the center of human governance. Unlike First Anchor (the ceremonial hub), Third Anchor has grown into a proper town. Most humans live here; some have "gone native" and are shunned by their peers.

### Second Anchor
An abandoned mining settlement to the west, evacuated 70 years ago under mysterious circumstances. Now secretly occupied by Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura's research team, who chose it for its existing infrastructure and distance from oversight.

## The Threat

**Main Antagonist/Threat**: Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura and her research team at Second Anchor
**Their Goal**: Disable the planetary nanomachine network they've discovered, believing it to be dangerous alien technology that should be neutralized
**Timeline**: Weeks to months - they're close to a breakthrough but need more data
**What Happens If They Succeed**: Ecological collapse. The nanomachines maintain Keth'toh's biosphere, the Vel'ashi's shape-shifting abilities, and countless other systems. Disabling them would be catastrophic.

## Campaign Arc (GM Eyes Only)

### Act 1: The Compass Points
The party investigates Nethara'kora's death and follows the artifact's guidance. They learn the Keth'vorah have been tracking unusual energy fluctuations originating from human settlements. The compass leads them through ancient sites, revealing glimpses of what the Vel'ashi once were - and hints that the "magic" everyone takes for granted has a source.

### Act 2: The Nature of Things
The party discovers the truth: Keth'toh's "magic" comes from an ancient nanomachine network, and humans at Second Anchor are trying to shut it down. They believe it's a dangerous alien system, unaware that it's been maintaining the planet for millennia. The party must navigate growing tensions between species, factions within the Keth'vorah who have different ideas about how to respond, and the researchers who think they're saving everyone.

### Act 3: The Choice
The party must stop the researchers, but force isn't the only option. Hessa Tolvren-Nakamura isn't evil - she's afraid of what she doesn't understand. The party can reveal the truth, find a compromise, or take more drastic action. The climax forces a choice about Keth'toh's future: preserve comfortable ignorance, embrace dangerous knowledge, or find a third path.

## Notable Items

### The Wayfinder (Eth'koru in native tongue)
- **Type**: Ancient artifact/compass
- **Location**: Currently with the party
- **Significance**: Points toward sites important to the nanomachine network. Was dormant for centuries until recently awakened by the researchers' experiments.

## House Rules

- "Magic" abilities are actually nanomachine interfaces - this is not known in-world
- Vel'ashi shape-shifting is limited (cosmetic changes, camouflage, not full transformation)
- Human variants have distinct mechanical differences:
  - Photosynthetic: Reduced food needs in light, vulnerable to prolonged darkness
  - Dark-adapted: Enhanced darkvision and hearing, light sensitivity
  - Cybernetic: Built-in tools/interfaces, but require maintenance

## Session Zero Notes

- **Content boundaries**: No gratuitous violence toward children or animals
- **Player expectations**: Investigation and discovery focused, combat exists but isn't the primary solution
- **Character connections**: Party will form around the dying investigator's final request - strangers bound by circumstance and conscience

## GM Guidance: Early Levels

### Combat at Level 1
The party is fragile at level 1. Early combat should generally offer non-lethal resolution paths:
- **Detention over death**: Enemies who defeat the party should capture/detain them rather than kill, creating escape scenarios
- **Avoidable encounters**: Most early threats can be talked past, snuck around, or otherwise avoided
- **Consequences without TPK**: A failed fight might mean losing the artifact temporarily, being questioned by authorities, or making an enemy - not immediate death
- **Escalating stakes**: Save lethal combat for moments where it matters narratively

### Early Power Growth
Give opportunities for the party to grow stronger without throwing them into lethal combat:
- Information gathering (learns enemy weaknesses)
- Acquiring useful equipment (trauma injectors, flash charges)
- Making allies who can provide backup
- Exploring ancient sites for minor artifacts or knowledge
