## Recent Events Summary

The party members have each received a discreet message: "Employment opportunity. Good coin. Meet at the Blushing Mermaid, back booth, tonight. Ask for Vendrath." Some know Lysara by reputation - a sharp businesswoman who runs a trading company that operates in the grey areas of legality. She pays well, keeps her word, and doesn't ask her people to do anything she wouldn't do herself. That last part might not be as comforting as it sounds.

The Lower City has been uneasy lately. Rumors of sickness spreading through the docks. Workers who show up to shifts but seem... absent. A priest found dead in an alley with no wounds but no life in his eyes. The Flaming Fist says it's plague fear. The Guild says someone's moving in on their territory. The Watch says nothing at all.

## Unresolved Threads

- Why is Vendrath Holdings being specifically targeted?
- What is causing the rot in the warehouses?
- What happened to the workers who fell ill?
- Why won't the Flaming Fist investigate?

## NPC Relationships
