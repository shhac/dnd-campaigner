# Vendrath Holdings

**Type**: Trading Company (legitimate and grey market)
**Influence**: Local (Baldur's Gate, some Sword Coast connections)
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

A mid-tier trading company that has carved out a profitable niche in Baldur's Gate by being willing to handle cargo that larger companies won't touch. Vendrath Holdings deals in legitimate goods, discreet transportation, and asks few questions about what's in the crates. They're not criminals - they're pragmatists. Lysara Vendrath inherited the company from her father and has grown it through sharp dealing and a reputation for keeping her word.

## Goals

**Public Goal**: Profitable trade, business growth, protecting their market share
**True Goal**: Same - Lysara wants wealth, influence, and security for her people. She's not hiding a secret agenda; she's just ruthlessly practical about achieving her goals.

## Methods

- Competitive pricing for "no questions asked" cargo
- Maintaining relationships with Guild contacts for mutual benefit
- Employing capable people and treating them well enough to ensure loyalty
- Paying the right bribes to the right officials
- Keeping detailed records (for leverage as much as accounting)

**Hierarchy**:
- Lysara Vendrath (Owner)

**Membership**: Approximately 80-100 employees across warehouses, offices, and ships

## Resources

- **Wealth**: Moderate (comfortable but not wealthy by noble standards)
- **Military**: Limited (security guards, hired muscle when needed)
- **Magic**: Minimal (a few protective wards on warehouses)
- **Political**: Some (bribes and favors with mid-level officials)

## Hooks & Opportunities

- Lysara can provide gold, information, and resources to the party
- Her warehouses are the crime scene for the initial investigation
- Her network of contacts throughout the Lower City can open doors
- She may have leverage on useful people if the party needs pressure applied
- If threatened, she's a potential victim to protect

## GM Notes

Lysara Vendrath is **not** secretly evil, cult-connected, or hiding anything worse than typical grey-market trading. She is exactly what she appears to be: a smart businesswoman who operates in moral grey areas but has genuine loyalty to her people and keeps her word.

This makes her a reliable patron and creates contrast with the corruption everywhere else. The party should be able to trust her - which makes her valuable and also a potential hostage if the cult realizes the party is a threat.

Her one warehouse sits unknowingly above a collapsed section of the old Bhaal temple's tunnel network. The cult wants access. They're trying to force her out of business or hollow her key employees to gain access without attention.

If the party keeps her informed and involved, she becomes a powerful ally. If they cut her out, she may take matters into her own hands and complicate things.
