# The Hollow Congregation

**Type**: Cult (evolved existential horror)
**Influence**: Local (Baldur's Gate), spreading
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

What began as a Bhaal death cult transformed into something far stranger. After their god fell silent during the Time of Troubles, the most devoted cultists kept reaching into the void - and something reached back. Now they worship entropy itself, the beautiful emptiness between thoughts, the silence after the last breath. They call their patron "The Absence" and seek to spread its gift of perfect, peaceful nothingness.

## Goals

**Public Goal**: They have no public presence. They don't exist.
**True Goal**: To "hollow" Baldur's Gate - draining every living thing of its vitality, identity, and eventually existence, creating a spreading void that will consume reality itself.

## Methods

- Infiltrating institutions through blackmail, bribery, or hollowing key figures
- Draining victims slowly through proximity to hollow-touched items or direct ritual
- Converting the desperate and nihilistic with promises of peace from suffering
- Operating through the sewers and forgotten spaces beneath the city
- Using the hollowed as drones for menial tasks and early warning

## Structure

**Leadership**: The Absence (entity), served by the Hollow Voice (mortal prophet)
**Hierarchy**:
- The Absence (patron entity)
- The Hollow Voice (prophet, unknown identity)
- The Vacant (inner circle, fully initiated)
- The Emptied (outer circle, partially hollowed servants)
- The Hollowed (victims, not members but tools)

**Membership**: Perhaps 30-50 true cultists, dozens of unknowing pawns and partially hollowed victims

## Resources

- **Wealth**: Moderate (stolen from victims, donated by corrupted nobles)
- **Military**: Limited (but hollowed make terrifying shock troops)
- **Magic**: Significant (void-touched abilities, entropy magic)
- **Political**: Some (three Parliament members, one Flaming Fist sergeant)

## Symbols & Recognition

**Symbol**: An empty circle, sometimes with a line through it suggesting a face with no features
**Colors**: Grey and pale white
**Recognition Signs**: Tapping the chest twice over the heart with two fingers (indicating emptiness within), speaking of "the peace" or "the quiet"

## Relationship to Party

**Current Standing**: Unknown (party doesn't know they exist yet)
**History**: None - but the cult knows someone is investigating

## Relationship to Other Factions

| Flaming Fist | Compromised (one asset in place) |
| The Guild | Enemy (territorial conflict in sewers) |
| Parliament of Peers | Infiltrated (three members) |

## Hooks & Opportunities

- Finding a hollow charm reveals cult existence
- Capturing a cultist could provide information (if they're not too far gone)
- The Vacant members are vulnerabilities - they still have things to lose
- The original Bhaal temple beneath the city holds clues to what The Absence really is

## GM Notes

**The Absence** is deliberately ambiguous - possible origins:
1. A shard of Bhaal that went mad during the god's death
2. An entity from the Far Realm drawn by the cult's reaching
3. A manifestation of collective nihilism that gained sentience
4. Something from the Negative Energy Plane
5. All of the above, none of the above

The Hollow Voice is **Veris Mourncrow**, a former priest of Kelemvor who lost his family to plague and found the cult's message of peaceful oblivion appealing. He is fully committed but retains enough personality to be a character rather than a monster.

The cult's timeline: they need approximately 100 more victims hollowed before they can attempt the Great Emptying ritual. They're currently at about 60. The party has weeks, not days, but the clock is ticking.
