# The Guild

**Type**: Criminal Organization (Thieves' Guild)
**Influence**: Local (controls criminal enterprise in Baldur's Gate)
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

The Guild controls organized crime in Baldur's Gate - theft, smuggling, fencing, gambling, protection rackets, and information brokering. They're not street thugs; they're professionals who understand that violence is bad for business. The Guild maintains order in the underworld, and that order benefits everyone from merchants who pay protection to nobles who need things done quietly. Their leader, Nine-Fingers Keene, runs a tight ship.

## Goals

**Public Goal**: They don't have a public presence - officially, the Guild doesn't exist
**True Goal**: Maintain monopoly on organized crime, protect their territory and people, profit

## Methods

- Control through organization rather than brutality
- Information as currency - knowing secrets is power
- Maintaining relationships with corrupt officials
- Ruthless elimination of competition
- Using the sewer network for movement and smuggling

## Structure

**Leadership**: Nine-Fingers Keene (Kingpin)
**Hierarchy**:
- Nine-Fingers (overall leader)
- Hands (senior lieutenants, each controls a district or operation)
- Fingers (mid-level operatives)
- Thumbs (street-level members)
- Associates (non-members who work with the Guild)

**Membership**: 200-300 members, plus hundreds of associates and informants

## Resources

- **Wealth**: Wealthy (crime pays well in a port city)
- **Military**: Militia (skilled rogues, assassins when needed)
- **Magic**: Limited (a few specialists, mostly non-magical)
- **Political**: Significant (blackmail, bribes, favors owed)

## Key Members

| Name | Role | Notes |

| The Fetch | Hand (Information) | Spymaster, knows everything, sells nothing cheaply |
| Corris Tane | Finger (Lower City) | Street contact, might approach the party |

## Symbols & Recognition

**Symbol**: A hand with fingers spread (unofficial, varies)
**Colors**: None official - blending in is the point
**Recognition Signs**: Coded phrases, specific hand gestures, knowing the right names

## Relationship to Party

**Current Standing**: Unknown/Neutral
**History**: None yet, but they're aware someone is investigating the Vendrath situation

## Relationship to Other Factions

| Faction | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| Hollow Congregation | Enemy (losing people, territorial conflict) |
| Vendrath Holdings | Business partners (mutual benefit) |
| Flaming Fist | Hostile officially, pragmatic unofficially |
| Parliament of Peers | Useful idiots (nobles are easy to blackmail) |

## Hooks & Opportunities

- The Guild knows the sewers - they can provide maps and safe passage
- They're losing people to the cult and want answers
- Nine-Fingers might hire the party or form an alliance against the cult
- Guild information networks can reveal cult activities
- Wiven Mirsk can guide them through dangerous sewer sections

## GM Notes

The Guild is a **potential ally**, not an enemy. They're criminals, but they're practical criminals who understand that an apocalyptic cult is bad for business. You can't run a protection racket in a dead city.

**Nine-Fingers Keene** is aware something supernatural is happening in the sewers. She's lost three operatives in the past month - not killed, but... wrong. They came back empty. One had to be put down when she attacked her own crew. The Guild is scared, and Nine-Fingers doesn't like being scared.

If the party enters Guild territory in the sewers, they'll be approached - not attacked, approached. The Guild wants information. If the party shares what they know, they could gain a powerful ally. If they're hostile or dismissive, the Guild will watch them, neither helping nor hindering.

**Wiven Mirsk** is the key contact. He's old, he knows every tunnel, and he's seen the hollowed. He'll guide the party if Nine-Fingers approves - or if they earn his respect by surviving something he didn't think they'd survive.

The Guild's sewer maps don't show the cult's territory accurately - those tunnels have been avoided since people started disappearing. But they show everything else, and that's invaluable.
