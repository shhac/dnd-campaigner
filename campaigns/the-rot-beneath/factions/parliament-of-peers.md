# Parliament of Peers

**Type**: Aristocratic Government
**Influence**: Dominant (official ruling body of Baldur's Gate)
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

The Parliament of Peers is the governing body of Baldur's Gate - a council of the city's wealthiest and most powerful families. They control policy, taxation, trade regulations, and officially direct the Flaming Fist. In practice, they spend most of their time on political infighting, protecting their fortunes, and maintaining the social order that keeps them on top. Some are capable administrators. Some are corrupt parasites. And three are members of the Hollow Congregation.

## Goals

**Public Goal**: Govern Baldur's Gate for the prosperity of all citizens
**True Goal**: Maintain wealth, power, and status for the noble families. Everything else is secondary.

## Methods

- Legal authority and official power
- Control of trade regulations and taxation
- Direction of the Flaming Fist
- Social pressure and aristocratic politics
- Wealth used as weapon and shield

## Structure

**Leadership**: Council of Dukes (rotating leadership among the four Dukes)
**Hierarchy**:
- Grand Dukes (four families: Portyr, Silvershield, Stelmane, Belt)
- Parliament Members (lesser nobility, wealthy merchants elevated to status)

- Everyone else (the governed masses)

**Membership**: Approximately 50 Parliament members, plus hundreds of officials and servants

## Resources

## Hooks & Opportunities

- Evidence against the compromised Peers could be politically explosive
- Lady Silvershield might become an ally if she sees advantage in it
- Parliament's resources could be turned against the cult with the right pressure
- Noble parties and gatherings are opportunities for investigation
- The cult uses Parliament meetings to coordinate

## GM Notes

The Parliament is **not** a unified enemy - it's a fractured political body with competing interests. Three members are cult-aligned, but most are simply self-interested nobles who have no idea what's happening beneath their city.

**The Compromised Peers:**

**Aldric Portyr** - The Duke's nephew, a bored young noble who was recruited by promises of "transcendence" and power. He genuinely believes the cult's philosophy and actively recruits among dissatisfied nobility. He's arrogant and careless - a potential weak point.

**Lady Bormul** - A widow who joined the cult after her husband's death, seeking meaning in oblivion. She provides servants and household staff as victims, claiming they "ran off" or "took ill." She's more committed than Aldric but more cautious.

**Councilor Dillard Wren** - A lawyer and bureaucrat who handles the cult's legal protection. He ensures investigations are misdirected, evidence disappears, and the right officials are bribed. He's a coward who joined for survival after seeing too much - he might be turned with the right pressure.

**Potential Ally:**

**Lady Alyth Silvershield** is ambitious, ruthless, and not involved with the cult. She's suspicious of Wren and Bormul (political instinct, not knowledge of the cult). If the party approaches her with evidence, she might help - not from altruism, but because destroying rivals and positioning herself as the one who saved the city would be excellent politics.
