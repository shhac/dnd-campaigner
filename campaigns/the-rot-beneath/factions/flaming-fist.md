# The Flaming Fist

**Type**: Mercenary Military / Law Enforcement
**Influence**: Dominant in Baldur's Gate
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

The Flaming Fist serves as Baldur's Gate's primary military and police force - a mercenary company that has essentially become the law. They maintain order, defend the walls, and enforce the will of the Parliament of Peers. They're not corrupt by design, but they're not incorruptible either. Most Fist soldiers are decent people doing a hard job. Some are thugs with badges. And at least one is compromised by the Hollow Congregation.

## Goals

**Public Goal**: Maintain order in Baldur's Gate, defend the city, uphold the law
**True Goal**: Protect Flaming Fist interests, maintain their power and funding, avoid problems that make them look bad

## Methods

- Visible patrols and checkpoints (especially in the Upper City)
- Quick response to violence and theft (slower in Lower City)
- Protecting merchants and nobles who pay protection fees
- Occasional crackdowns to remind everyone who's in charge
- Looking the other way for the right price or favor

## Structure

**Leadership**: Grand Marshal Ulder Ravengard (absent, dealing with regional matters), day-to-day operations run by subordinate officers
**Hierarchy**:
- Grand Marshal (supreme command)
- Marshals (senior officers)
- Flamers (junior officers)
- Fists (rank and file soldiers)

**Membership**: Several thousand soldiers, though many are deployed outside the city

## Resources

- **Wealth**: Wealthy (city funding, mercenary contracts, "fees")
- **Military**: Army (the primary military force in the region)
- **Magic**: Limited (a few war mages, healing support)
- **Political**: Significant (they ARE the enforcement arm of the Parliament)

## Key Members

| Flamer Drex Corvan | Street Officer | Corrupt, takes bribes, useful for information |

## Symbols & Recognition

**Recognition Signs**: Uniforms, badges of rank, the fist symbol on tabards and shields

## Relationship to Other Factions

| Faction | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|

| Vendrath Holdings | Tolerated (bribes accepted, protection provided) |
| The Guild | Hostile officially, pragmatic unofficially |
| Parliament of Peers | Serves (they fund and direct the Fist) |

## Hooks & Opportunities

- Lieutenant Ashford could become an ally if given evidence of cult activity
- Exposing Sergeant Thane would remove a cult asset and possibly gain Fist cooperation
- Bribing the right Fists can get information or access
- If the cult threat becomes undeniable, the Fist could become powerful allies in the finale
- Flamer Corvan sells information to anyone with coin

## GM Notes

The Flaming Fist is **not** wholly corrupt or evil. Most soldiers are doing their jobs. The organization is compromised at one specific point: **Sergeant Korvus Thane**, who is being blackmailed over gambling debts and a murder he committed years ago. The cult has evidence that would see him hanged.

Thane is suppressing investigations into the "sickness" and redirecting Fist attention elsewhere. He doesn't know the full scope of what the cult is doing - he thinks he's covering up some noble's crimes, not enabling an apocalyptic ritual.

**Lieutenant Moira Ashford** is a genuinely good officer who knows something is wrong but can't figure out why her reports keep getting buried. She's overworked, understaffed, and frustrated. If the party brings her solid evidence and earns her trust, she could become a valuable ally - and potentially help them expose Thane.

Grand Marshal Ravengard's absence is convenient for the cult. If he returns before the finale, he could be a powerful ally - or a complication if he decides to handle things his way.
