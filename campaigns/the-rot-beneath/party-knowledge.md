## Current Situation

**Location**: The Blushing Mermaid, Lower City, Baldur's Gate
**Time**: Late evening, a damp autumn night
**What's happening**: The party has been summoned to the Blushing Mermaid's back booth by Lysara Vendrath's assistant. They've received word of a job offer - good pay, discretion expected. Most have worked for Vendrath Holdings before in some capacity.

## Active Quests

### The Vendrath Job (Pending)
- **Objective**: Investigate warehouse thefts and strange blight affecting Vendrath Holdings
- **Given by**: Lysara Vendrath (meeting imminent)
- **What we know**:
  - Goods are rotting in locked warehouses overnight
  - Workers are falling ill - rumors describe them as "hollowed out"
  - The Flaming Fist and Watch aren't helping
  - Vendrath suspects someone is targeting her specifically
- **Current progress**: About to receive full job details

## Locations We've Visited

### The Blushing Mermaid
- **What it is**: A notorious tavern in the Lower City. Neutral ground for information brokers, criminals, and those who need to disappear. Vendrath's people drink here.
- **What we found/did there**: Current meeting location for job discussion

### The Lower City (General)
- **What it is**: The cramped, maze-like streets where most of Baldur's Gate actually lives. Legitimate businesses, taverns, warehouses, and homes packed together.
- **What we know**: This is where Vendrath Holdings operates, and where the rot first began to spread.

## Important Information Learned

- The Lower City has been uneasy lately - rumors of sickness spreading through the docks
- Workers are showing up to shifts but seem absent, wrong somehow
- A priest was found dead in an alley with no wounds but no life in his eyes
- The Flaming Fist claims it's "plague fear"
- The Guild says someone's moving in on their territory
- The Watch says nothing at all

## Unresolved Questions

- Why is Vendrath Holdings being specifically targeted?
- What is causing the rot in the warehouses?
- What exactly happened to the workers who fell ill? What does "hollowed out" mean?
