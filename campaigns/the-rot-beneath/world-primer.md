# World Primer: Baldur's Gate

What any resident of Baldur's Gate would know.

---

## The City

Baldur's Gate is one of the largest cities on the Sword Coast, a sprawling port built on trade, ambition, and a healthy disregard for scruples. It sits along the River Chionthar, a gateway between the civilized north and the wilder south. The city is wealthy, crowded, and dangerous in roughly equal measure.

## The Three Cities

Baldur's Gate is really three cities stacked on top of each other:

- **The Upper City**: Behind walls and guarded gates, the wealthy and powerful live in relative comfort. The Parliament of Peers governs from here — dukes, patriars, and old-money families who consider the rest of the city a necessary inconvenience. Clean streets, fine homes, dirty politics.
- **The Lower City**: Where most people actually live. A maze of cramped streets packed with shops, taverns, warehouses, and tenements. Honest work exists alongside petty crime. This is the beating heart of the Gate — noisy, smelly, and alive.
- **The Outer City**: Beyond the walls, technically not part of Baldur's Gate at all. Shanties, refugee camps, and businesses too disreputable even for the Lower City. No legal protections. No city services. Survive or don't.

## Who Keeps Order

- **The Flaming Fist**: A mercenary company that serves as the city's law enforcement. They keep order in the Lower City — after a fashion. Underpaid, overstretched, and not above taking bribes. Better than nothing, but not by much.
- **The Watch**: Guards the Upper City and answers to the patriars. Better equipped, better paid, and completely uninterested in what happens below the walls.
- **The Guild**: Everyone knows the thieves' guild exists. Everyone pretends it doesn't. They control organized crime, run protection rackets, and use the sewers like a private highway. Cross them at your peril.

## The Sewers

Ancient tunnels beneath the city — older than Baldur's Gate itself. Unmapped, dangerous, and used by smugglers, the Guild, and things best not thought about. Most residents know to stay out. Workers who maintain the accessible sections earn hazard pay and drink heavily.

## Common Knowledge

- **The Blushing Mermaid**: A notorious Lower City tavern. Neutral ground for information brokers, criminals, and anyone who needs to have a quiet conversation. Everyone knows it; the Fist leaves it alone.
- **Vendrath Holdings**: A mid-tier trading company operating in the Lower City. Pays well, asks few questions. Run by Lysara Vendrath — known to treat her people fairly, which makes her unusual among employers.
- **The Parliament of Peers**: The dukes and patriars who govern the city from the Upper City. Officially they serve the people. Unofficially, they serve themselves. Some are better than others. None are saints.

## Recent Troubles

Something is wrong in the Lower City. Goods are rotting in sealed warehouses overnight. Workers are turning up hollow-eyed and listless, as if something vital has been drained from them. The Fist calls it disease. The Watch doesn't care. People who work the docks and warehouses know better — this isn't natural. But nobody with power is listening.
