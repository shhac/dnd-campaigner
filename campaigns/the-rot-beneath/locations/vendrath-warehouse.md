# Vendrath Warehouse (District 7)

**Type**: Commercial Building
**Region**: Lower City Docks, Baldur's Gate
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

One of four warehouses operated by Vendrath Holdings, this one sits on the eastern edge of the docks district. It's a sturdy stone-and-timber building, three stories tall, used for storing goods that need to stay dry and secure. Recently, it's become the epicenter of strange events: goods rotting overnight, workers falling ill, and an uncanny feeling that something is deeply wrong.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: Rows of crates and barrels, some sealed, some broken open revealing ruined contents. Patches of grey-green mold spreading in corners where there shouldn't be moisture. Dim light from high windows caked with grime.
**Sounds**: Creaking timbers, rats in the walls, the distant sounds of the docks. And sometimes, in the quiet moments, a faint susurrus like distant whispering.
**Smells**: Rot. Even goods that should be fine carry a faint smell of decay. Workers have started wearing cloth over their faces.
**Feeling**: Wrong. The air feels heavy, like before a storm, but the storm never comes. Workers hurry through their tasks and leave as soon as they can.

## Key Features

### The Rot Patches
Several areas of the warehouse floor and walls show patches of grey-green corruption. It's not quite mold, not quite decay - it eats organic material but seems almost deliberate in what it consumes. Alchemists who examined it had no explanation.

### The Bad Corner
The northeast corner where workers refuse to go. Two workers who spent time there fell ill with the "hollowing sickness." Lysara has had it blocked off with barrels.

### The Cellar
A storage cellar that's always been here. But recently, workers have heard sounds from below - not rats, something else. No one has gone down to check.

## Notable NPCs Here

| NPC | Role | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| Haskell Vorn | Warehouse Manager | Nervous, overworked, desperate for answers |
| Workers | Various | Scared, some refuse to enter certain areas |
| Tomlin Greer | Missing Worker | Last seen here a week ago, hasn't returned home |

## Points of Interest

- **Ruined Cargo**: Crates of grain that turned to grey dust overnight. Preserved meats that liquefied in their sealed containers. Evidence of supernatural decay.
- **Worker Records**: Lysara can provide records of which workers fell ill and when. Pattern suggests exposure to the bad corner.
- **Tomlin's Belongings**: His coat and lunch pail are still here. He didn't leave voluntarily.

## Encounters

### Likely Encounters
- **Investigation**: Searching the rot patches for clues, questioning workers.
- **The Cellar**: Something is down there. First expedition will reveal the passage to the old tunnels.

### Possible Encounters
- **A Hollowed**: If the party investigates at night, they might encounter one of the hollowed drawn to this place.
- **Cult Observer**: Someone watching the warehouse, reporting on who investigates.

## Secrets & Hidden Things

- The cellar has a collapsed wall that leads to ancient tunnels - part of the old Bhaal temple network
- A hollow charm is hidden in the bad corner, left by a cultist to draw power through the location
- Tomlin Greer's trail leads from here into the sewers
- The rot is spreading slowly outward - in another month, it will affect neighboring buildings

## History

This warehouse was built sixty years ago by Lysara's father, Koros Vendrath. He bought the land cheap because of its "bad reputation" - locals whispered about the ground being cursed. Koros dismissed it as superstition and built anyway. For decades, nothing happened. Now, something has awakened below.

## GM Notes

This is the **primary crime scene** for the initial investigation. Everything the party needs to start unraveling the cult's activities is here.

**What they can find:**
- Evidence that the rot is supernatural (DC 12 Arcana or Religion check)
- The hollow charm in the bad corner (DC 14 Investigation to find, DC 12 Arcana to identify as magical)
- Worker testimony about the "hollowing sickness" and its progression
- Tomlin Greer's trail leading into the cellar

**The cellar:**
First time down, they'll find storage as expected - plus a collapsed wall that wasn't there before. Beyond it, ancient tunnels that shouldn't exist. These lead eventually to the sewer network and, deeper, to the cult's territory.

**The hollow charm** is a major clue. It's a small amulet of grey metal with an empty circle inscribed on it. While active, it slowly drains vitality from nearby living things (explaining the rot). Finding it and removing it will stop the spread at this location - but it's a symptom, not the disease.

**Escalation:**
If the party doesn't investigate soon, more workers will fall ill. Lysara will become desperate. The cult will become aware someone is poking around and take measures.
