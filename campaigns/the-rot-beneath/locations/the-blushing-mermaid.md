# The Blushing Mermaid

**Type**: Tavern
**Region**: Lower City, Baldur's Gate
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

A notorious tavern wedged between a chandler's shop and a boarding house in the Lower City's cramped streets. The Blushing Mermaid has served ale, information, and discretion for three generations. It's neutral ground for criminals, mercenaries, and those who need to meet without being noticed. The law knows about it and mostly leaves it alone - easier to watch one place than chase people through the whole city.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: Low ceilings black with decades of smoke, mismatched tables scarred by knife marks, a bar that's been polished to a shine by countless elbows. The mermaid on the sign outside is so faded she's barely visible.
**Sounds**: Low conversation, the clink of cups, occasional dice rattling in cups. People speak quietly here.
**Smells**: Spilled ale, pipe smoke, damp wool, and something savory from the kitchen that almost masks the smell of the Lower City outside.
**Feeling**: Guarded, watchful. Everyone's minding their own business while monitoring everyone else.

## Key Features

### The Back Booths
Private booths with high wooden backs and curtains that can be drawn. The traditional spot for discreet meetings. Lysara Vendrath uses one for hiring.

### The Counting Room
A private room upstairs, available for rent by the hour. Soundproofed by thick rugs. Used for conversations no one should overhear.

## Points of Interest

- **Agathe's Memory**: She's been running this place for forty years and remembers everything. For the right price (favors, not gold), she'll share.
- **The Message Board**: A board near the back where coded messages are left. If you know how to read it, you can find work or contacts.
- **The Cellar**: Connects to sewer access points. The Guild uses it for quick exits.

## Encounters

### Likely Encounters
- **Information Brokers**: People who sell rumors and secrets. Varying reliability.
- **Mercenaries**: Looking for work or spending their pay.
- **Guild Presence**: Low-level Guild members. They're watching, not threatening.

### Possible Encounters
- **Flaming Fist Patrol**: Rare, but they do check in sometimes. Everyone clams up.
- **Cult Scouts**: The congregation has eyes here too - someone watching who's meeting whom.

## Secrets & Hidden Things

- The cellar has a concealed door that leads to a Guild-maintained sewer passage
- Agathe Salt is a former Guild member who retired with Nine-Fingers' blessing
- The "counting room" has a hidden listening post - Agathe hears everything said there

## History

The Blushing Mermaid was founded by Agathe's grandmother, a smuggler who needed a respectable front. Three generations later, it's become an institution. The Guild considers it protected territory. The Flaming Fist considers it useful for intelligence. Everyone agrees it's neutral ground.

## GM Notes

The Mermaid is a **safe base of operations** for the party. It's where they can meet contacts, gather information, and rest without worrying about ambush. The neutrality is enforced - violence here would bring down everyone on the offender.

**Agathe Salt** is a useful information source. She knows who's been meeting whom, who looks nervous, who's been asking questions. She won't volunteer this, but she'll trade for favors (not gold - she has enough money). Favors might include dealing with rowdy customers, delivering messages, or handling problems for old friends.

**Corris Tane** is a Guild finger who can introduce the party to Nine-Fingers if they make a good impression. He'll approach them if they seem competent and like they're investigating the same problems the Guild is facing.

The cellar sewer access is a potential emergency exit - or a way into the underground if the party needs to move discreetly.
