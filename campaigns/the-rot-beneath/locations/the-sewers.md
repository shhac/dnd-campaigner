# The Sewers

**Type**: Underground Network
**Region**: Beneath Baldur's Gate
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

A vast labyrinth of tunnels, passages, and chambers beneath Baldur's Gate, accumulating over centuries of construction and reconstruction. What began as Roman-style drainage has been expanded, collapsed, rebuilt, and connected to natural caverns and ancient temple complexes. The Guild uses it for smuggling. Monsters call it home. And now, something else has moved in.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: Dripping stone tunnels lit by occasional grates letting in filtered daylight. Older sections with carved walls and forgotten symbols. Newer brick passages running with waste water. And in some places, patches of grey corruption spreading across the walls.
**Sounds**: Dripping water everywhere. Rats squeaking. Echoes that travel strangely. Distant sounds that might be voices or might be imagination.
**Smells**: The expected sewer smells - waste, rot, damp stone. But in some areas, an absence of smell, an unnatural sterility that's somehow worse.
**Feeling**: Claustrophobic, disorienting, dangerous. Easy to get lost. Easy to be ambushed. Easy to never come back up.

## Key Features

### Guild Territory
Well-maintained passages used for smuggling, with hidden signs marking safe routes. The Guild patrols here and maintains order.

### The Old Works
Ancient tunnels from the city's earliest days. Some are part of old temples. Some are natural caves. Many are unmapped.

### The Grey Zones
Areas where the corruption has spread. The walls feel wrong. Light doesn't travel as far. The hollowed have been seen here.

### The Hollow Heart (Act 3)
The cult's sanctum, deep beneath the city. Location unknown until the party discovers it.

## Notable NPCs Here

| NPC | Role | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| Wiven Mirsk | Guild Guide | Knows the tunnels better than anyone alive |
| The Hollowed | Victims/Enemies | Former people, now empty vessels |
| Tomlin Greer | Missing Worker | Somewhere down here, partially hollowed |
| Otyugh | Monster | Several in the waste channels, territorial but avoidable |

## Points of Interest

- **Guild Waystation**: A hidden chamber with supplies, a safe place to rest if the Guild trusts you.
- **The Old Temple Fragment**: Part of the ancient Bhaal temple, partially collapsed. Clues to what The Absence might be.
- **The Remembrance Bell** (rumored): An artifact from a temple of Ilmater, said to restore lost identity. May or may not exist.
- **The Grey Threshold**: Where Guild territory ends and cult territory begins. Beyond here, there be monsters.

## Encounters

### Likely Encounters
- **Rats and Vermin**: Giant rats, swarms, and similar mundane threats.
- **Guild Patrols**: In their territory. Potentially friendly if the party has an introduction.
- **Navigation Challenges**: Getting lost, wrong turns, dead ends.

### Possible Encounters
- **Otyugh**: Territorial monsters in waste areas. Can be avoided or negotiated with (they're not stupid).
- **The Hollowed**: Former people, now empty. They don't attack unless directed, but they're deeply unnerving.
- **Carrion Crawler**: Attracted to the rot and the hollowed.
- **Cult Patrol**: Outer scouts for the Hollow Congregation.

## Secrets & Hidden Things

- The Old Temple Fragment contains murals depicting Bhaal's death and something emerging from the void he left
- Tomlin Greer hides in a junction near the Grey Threshold, partially hollowed but still fighting
- The cult has been sealing certain passages to funnel intruders toward traps
- An ancient well shaft connects directly to the Hollow Heart - if you know where to look

## History

The sewers are a palimpsest of Baldur's Gate's history. Each layer built on the last: natural caves used by the first settlers, temple complexes from the city's early days (including a Bhaal temple destroyed and buried after the god's first death), formal sewers from the city's growth, and modern repairs. The cult found the old temple and made it their own.

## GM Notes

The sewers are the **primary environment for Act 2**. They should feel dangerous, confusing, and increasingly corrupted as the party goes deeper.

**Navigation:**
Without a guide, the party will get lost. With Wiven Mirsk or Guild maps, they can navigate safely through known territory. Beyond Guild territory, even maps fail.

**Environmental hazards:**
- Getting lost (Survival DC 15 without guidance)
- Bad air in certain areas (Constitution saves)
- Flooding during rain
- Cave-ins in unstable sections
- The corruption itself (Wisdom saves against despair, eventually)

**The Grey Zones:**
As the party ventures deeper, they enter corrupted territory. Signs include:
- Light sources dim (reduce range by half)
- Food and water taste of nothing
- Sleep is restless and dreamless
- Short rests take longer; long rests are impossible in deep corruption

**Pacing:**
The sewer exploration should take multiple sessions. Each expedition goes a little deeper, learns a little more, and faces escalating threats. Build tension through atmosphere, not just combat.

**The Hollow Heart** is the final destination, but the party shouldn't find it easily. They need to piece together clues, interrogate cultists, or have Tomlin Greer (if saved) guide them.
