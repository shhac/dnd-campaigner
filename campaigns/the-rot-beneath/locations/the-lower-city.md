# The Lower City

**Type**: Urban District
**Region**: Baldur's Gate
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Overview

The heart of Baldur's Gate - not the rich heart the nobles claim, but the working heart that actually keeps the city alive. The Lower City is a maze of cramped streets, leaning buildings, and humanity packed tight. Here live the dockers, crafters, sailors, and everyone else who makes Baldur's Gate function. It's dirty, loud, dangerous after dark, and more alive than the Upper City could ever be.

## Atmosphere

**Sights**: Buildings crowded so close you can shake hands across the street from upper windows. Laundry strung between buildings. Street vendors, beggars, children running, carts stuck in impossible traffic. Every surface covered in handbills, graffiti, or grime.
**Sounds**: Never quiet. Hawkers shouting, hammers ringing, arguments, laughter, babies crying, and from the docks, the constant creaking of ships and calling of gulls.
**Smells**: Fish from the docks, smoke from a hundred chimneys, cooking food, refuse in gutters, the salt of the harbor. All of it mixed together into the unique perfume of a living city.
**Feeling**: Crowded, alive, watchful. Opportunity and danger in equal measure. People who mind their own business and notice everything.

## Key Features

### The Docks
The economic engine of Baldur's Gate. Ships from across the Sea of Swords unload cargo that spreads throughout the Sword Coast. Vendrath Holdings operates here.

### The Marketplaces
Several open squares where goods are sold daily. Legal goods by day, less legal goods by night. Information flows through here as readily as commerce.

### The Gate to the Outer City
Where the truly poor live outside the walls. Refugees, the desperate, and those who can't afford even Lower City housing. The cult has found easy victims here.

## Points of Interest

- **The Blushing Mermaid**: Neutral ground tavern, good for meetings and information.
- **Vendrath Warehouse (District 7)**: Primary crime scene for the initial investigation.
- **Flaming Fist Barracks**: Lieutenant Ashford's precinct. Source of official help if they can get it.
- **The Shrine of Suffering**: A small temple to Ilmater, where the hollowing victims have been taken for care.
- **Sewer Access Points**: Multiple entries to the underground. The Guild controls most of them.

## Encounters

### Likely Encounters
- **Street Crime**: Pickpockets, muggers, con artists. Routine hazards of city life.
- **Guild Notice**: The Guild will become aware of the party's activities quickly.
- **Witnesses**: People who've seen strange things but are afraid to talk to the Watch.

### Possible Encounters
- **Hollowed Victim**: Someone in the early stages, seeming sick and confused.
- **Cult Recruiter**: Targeting the desperate, offering "peace from suffering."
- **Flaming Fist Patrol**: Possibly helpful, possibly obstructive depending on which officer.

## Secrets & Hidden Things

- The cult has been targeting the poorest areas, where disappearances go unnoticed
- Several sewer grates have been secretly sealed by the cult to control access
- An old temple to Bhaal once stood where the Shrine of Suffering is now - ironic or intentional?
- The "hollowing sickness" has affected more people than officially reported

## History

The Lower City has always been here, in one form or another. Before the walls expanded, this was outside. Before the trade routes solidified, this was a fishing village. The bones of old Baldur's Gate lie beneath these streets - including temples and tunnels that most have forgotten.

## GM Notes

The Lower City is the **primary adventuring environment** for Act 1. It's where the party will investigate, gather allies, and discover the cult's existence.

**Useful locations not yet detailed:**
- The Shrine of Suffering (where hollowed victims are cared for - and some disappear)
- The Elfsong Tavern (another famous tavern, more upscale than the Mermaid)
- The Low Lantern (a notorious inn built on a ship)
- The Watch Citadel (where official complaints go to die)

**Random encounter fuel:**
- Street preacher warning about "the emptiness spreading"
- Flaming Fist officer taking a bribe in plain sight
- Guild member watching from a rooftop
- Family searching for a missing loved one
- Merchant complaining about goods rotting inexplicably

**The mood:**
The Lower City is normally chaotic but functional. Lately, it's felt wrong. More beggars seem hollow-eyed. More businesses are closed. There's a tension in the air that everyone feels but no one can name. The city is afraid, even if it doesn't know of what yet.
