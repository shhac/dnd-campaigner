# The Rot Beneath

## Setting

**World**: Forgotten Realms
**Era/Time Period**: Current era, approximately 1492 DR
**Starting Location**: Baldur's Gate, Lower City

## Tone & Themes

**Tone**: Dark and gritty - a city where corruption festers in every institution, where the line between law and crime blurs, and where survival often means compromise.

**Core Themes**:
- **Power and Corruption**: Every faction is compromised. The question isn't who is clean, but who is useful.
- **Moral Ambiguity**: There are no pure heroes. Good people do terrible things. Monsters have reasons.
- **Greater Good vs Personal Bonds**: When saving the city means sacrificing someone you care about, what do you choose?
- **Forging Your Own Path**: In a world where every institution fails you, the only reliable alliance is the one you build yourself.

## The Hook

Work has been steady for those willing to get their hands dirty in Baldur's Gate. Vendrath Holdings, a mid-tier trading company known for its... flexible ethics, has been hiring muscle and investigators through quiet channels. The pay is good, the questions are few, and Lysara Vendrath treats her people well enough.

The latest job seemed straightforward: investigate a series of thefts from Vendrath warehouses in the Lower City. Goods are vanishing - not just stolen, but rotting away in locked rooms overnight. Worse, workers are calling in sick, then showing up hollow-eyed and listless, as if something vital has been drained from them. The Watch isn't interested. The Flaming Fist suggests it's "a disease problem, not a crime." Lysara suspects someone is targeting her specifically - and she wants to know who, why, and how to make them stop.

## Major Factions

### The Hollow Congregation
- **Type**: Cult (evolved from Bhaal worship)
- **Goals**: Spread entropy, drain vitality and identity from the living, prepare the city for "The Great Emptying"
- **Relationship to Party**: Primary antagonist (initially unknown)

### Vendrath Holdings
- **Type**: Trading Company / Employer
- **Goals**: Profit, survival, protecting their operations and people
- **Relationship to Party**: Employer / Patron

### The Flaming Fist
- **Type**: Mercenary Law Enforcement
- **Goals**: Maintain order (and their power), protect their own interests
- **Relationship to Party**: Neutral (compromised, unreliable)

### The Guild
- **Type**: Criminal Organization (Thieves' Guild)
- **Goals**: Control criminal enterprise in the city, protect their territory
- **Relationship to Party**: Potential ally (they know the sewers, they're losing people too)

### Parliament of Peers
- **Type**: Aristocratic Government
- **Goals**: Maintain wealth and status, political maneuvering
- **Relationship to Party**: Distant (some secretly aligned with cult)

## Key Locations

### The Lower City
The cramped, maze-like streets where most of Baldur's Gate actually lives. Legitimate businesses, taverns, warehouses, and homes packed together. This is where Vendrath Holdings operates, and where the rot first began to spread.

### The Sewers
A labyrinthine network beneath the city - ancient, unmapped, and dangerous. The Guild uses them for smuggling. Something else has moved in.

### The Blushing Mermaid
A notorious tavern in the Lower City. Neutral ground for information brokers, criminals, and those who need to disappear. Vendrath's people drink here.

### The Upper City
Where the wealthy live behind walls and guards. The Parliament of Peers meets here. Clean streets, clean consciences, dirty secrets.

## The Threat

**Main Antagonist/Threat**: The Hollow Congregation, led by the entity known only as "The Absence"
**Their Goal**: To "hollow out" Baldur's Gate - draining vitality, identity, and eventually existence itself from the population, creating a dead zone of emptiness that will spread
**Timeline**: Weeks to months - the rot accelerates as more are hollowed
**What Happens If They Succeed**: Baldur's Gate becomes a husk city - people walking but empty, buildings standing but lifeless, a spreading void that will consume the Sword Coast

## Campaign Arc (GM Eyes Only)

### Act 1: Investigation
The party investigates the warehouse thefts and strange blight for Vendrath Holdings. They discover the rot is spreading through the sewers, workers aren't just sick - they're being drained. Following the trail leads them to discover the Hollow Congregation's existence and realize this is far bigger than theft. The act climaxes with their first encounter with a Hollowed - what remains of a person after the cult finishes with them.

**Key discoveries:**
- The rot is supernatural, not disease
- People are being "hollowed" - drained of vitality and identity
- The Flaming Fist knows more than they're saying
- The Guild is losing people too and might help

### Act 2: Descent
The party must venture into the sewers and subterranean depths to find the cult's base of operations. They navigate Guild politics, avoid or confront compromised Flaming Fist officers, and discover that some Parliament members are feeding people to the cult. They learn the cult's history - they once worshipped Bhaal, but something changed. Now they worship nothingness itself.

**Key challenges:**
- Gaining Guild trust/passage through their territory
- Surviving increasingly dangerous hollowed creatures
- Discovering which Peers are compromised
- Finding the cult's sanctum without becoming victims themselves

### Act 3: Hollow Heart
The party descends to the cult's sanctum - the Hollow Heart - where "The Absence" dwells. They must stop the ritual that will hollow the entire city. But stopping it may require sacrifices, and the corruption reaches higher than they imagined. The finale forces impossible choices: who can be saved, what must be destroyed, and what compromises will haunt them after.

**Climax possibilities:**
- Direct confrontation with The Absence
- Collapsing the sanctum (at cost)
- Exposing the Parliament members (political upheaval)
- Saving or losing key NPCs based on earlier choices

## Notable Items

### Hollow Charm
- **Type**: Cursed Amulet
- **Location**: Found on cult operatives
- **Significance**: Protects wearer from being targeted for hollowing, but slowly drains the wearer if worn too long. A potential clue and dangerous tool.

### Vendrath Ledger
- **Type**: Documents
- **Location**: Lysara's office (given as reference)
- **Significance**: Records of thefts, worker illnesses, and patterns that reveal the cult's methodology

### The Remembrance Bell
- **Type**: Artifact (rumored)
- **Location**: Lost in the sewers
- **Significance**: An old temple relic said to restore identity to the lost. May be key to saving the hollowed - if it exists.

## House Rules

- **Gritty Realism**: Short rests are 8 hours, long rests require 24 hours in a safe location. Resources matter.
- **Lingering Injuries**: Critical hits and dropping to 0 HP may cause lasting effects (GM discretion).
- **Corruption Track**: Extended exposure to the hollow may inflict "Hollow Taint" - a condition tracked separately.
- **Theater of the Mind**: No grid combat. Positioning is narrative, not tactical.

## Session Zero Notes

- **Content boundaries**: Body horror is present but not gratuitous. No torture descriptions. The hollowing is existential horror (loss of self) rather than physical gore.
- **Player expectations**: This is a mystery-horror campaign. Investigation matters. Combat has consequences. Not everyone can be saved.
- **Character connections**: All PCs should have a reason to work for or with Vendrath Holdings. They may have their own agendas, but they need to take jobs.
