| **Race** | Human |
| **Occupation** | Nobleman / Parliament Member / Cult Recruiter |

## Appearance

A handsome young man with the polished look of old money - perfectly tailored clothes, manicured hands, carefully styled dark hair. He cultivates an air of elegant boredom, as if everything and everyone is slightly beneath his notice. But there's something wrong with his smile: it never quite reaches his eyes, which have a flat, hungry quality that observant people find unsettling.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Languid superiority masking genuine malice
**Motivation**: Power, transcendence, and the pleasure of corrupting others
**Fear**: Being ordinary, being nothing, dying forgettable

**Personality Traits**:
- Believes himself superior to everyone around him
- Enjoys corrupting others - the moment someone compromises themselves delights him
- Easily bored, constantly seeking new stimulations

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Drawling, ironic, lots of verbal flourishes. Makes everything sound like a private joke. Uses "darling" and similar endearments to create false intimacy.
**Mannerisms**: Theatrical hand gestures. Looking at people sideways. Smiling at inappropriate moments.
**Sample Dialogue**: "Oh, you're so *earnest*. It's charming, really. Like watching a puppy try to climb stairs. No, no - don't stop. I'm enjoying this."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- He's Duke Portyr's nephew, destined for nothing important but plenty comfortable
- He hosts famous parties, knows everyone, dabbles in art patronage
- He has a reputation for being clever but harmless

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- He won't reveal cult information willingly - unlike Veris, he enjoys his secrets

### Secrets (GM only)
- He's one of The Vacant - fully initiated into the Hollow Congregation
- He recruits among bored young nobles, offering "transcendence" and secret knowledge
- He's provided multiple victims for hollowing from his social circle
- He knows the identities of the other compromised Peers
- The Absence showed him a vision of the world after the Great Emptying, and he found it beautiful

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Amused contempt (if of low status) or predatory interest (if they seem useful)
**Current Disposition**: Unknown (hasn't encountered them yet)
**History with Party**: None

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Parliament of Peers, Hollow Congregation, noble society
**Potential Uses**:
- Encounter at noble functions
- Source of information about cult recruiting and Parliament infiltration
- Weak point - he's arrogant and might reveal too much
- Evidence against him could expose the cult's Parliament connections

## GM Notes

Aldric is a **hateable villain** - where Veris is sympathetic, Aldric is the one players can enjoy defeating. He's a privilege-poisoned aristocrat who joined a death cult because he was bored.

**His weaknesses:**
- Arrogance - he underestimates "commoners"
- He talks too much when he thinks he's in control
- His uncle Duke Portyr would be horrified - and the Duke has power
- He's not actually that tough in a fight

**His uses:**
- Encounter at a noble party gives the party a face to the cult's upper-class connections
- Capturing him alive could provide information about other compromised Peers
- Evidence of his cult involvement is leverage against the Parliament
- His eventual defeat is cathartic

**Roleplaying him:**
Make him insufferable. Every line should make players want to punch him. He's condescending, cruel in small ways, and absolutely certain of his own superiority. When he finally goes down, it should feel earned.

He doesn't know everything - Veris keeps the inner circle's secrets from the recruiters. Aldric knows about hollowing, knows about The Absence in vague terms, knows the other Vacant members. He doesn't know exactly where the Hollow Heart is or the full details of the Great Emptying ritual.
