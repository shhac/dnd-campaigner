| **Occupation** | Merchant (Trading Company Owner) |

## Appearance

A lean woman with sharp features and prematurely grey hair she keeps cropped short for practicality. Her clothes are well-made but not ostentatious - dark blues and practical cuts that allow movement. She wears a silver ring on her right hand that was her father's, and her hands show old calluses from years of loading cargo before she could afford to hire people to do it.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Direct, professional, watchful - she's always reading the room
**Motivation**: Protect her business, her people, and her hard-won success
**Fear**: Losing everything she's built, being powerless again

**Personality Traits**:
- Values competence over credentials - she doesn't care where you came from, only what you can do
- Keeps her word absolutely - her reputation is worth more than any single deal
- Pragmatic to a fault - she'll work with anyone useful and cut anyone who isn't

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Clipped, efficient sentences. Asks direct questions. Doesn't waste words on pleasantries but isn't rude. Slight Lower City accent she doesn't bother to hide.
**Mannerisms**: Maintains eye contact. Stands rather than sits when possible. Unconsciously touches her father's ring when stressed.
**Sample Dialogue**: "I don't need to know why. I need to know if you can do it, and what it will cost me."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- Her warehouses have been hit by thefts and strange rot
- Workers are falling ill - some haven't come back
- The Flaming Fist won't investigate
- She's offering good coin for answers

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- She suspects she's being specifically targeted, not random crime
- One of her warehouses sits on "bad ground" - workers have always reported strange sounds
- She has contacts in the Guild who confirmed something is wrong in the sewers
- The rot isn't natural - she's had alchemists look at samples

### Secrets (GM only)
- She's more scared than she lets on - this is beyond normal business problems
- Her father built the warehouse over that spot specifically because the land was cheap, but he never told her why it was cheap
- She knows Nine-Fingers Keene personally from her youth - they grew up on the same streets

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Assessing - she'll test their competence with pointed questions before committing
**Current Disposition**: Professional interest
**History with Party**: Has likely used some party members for smaller jobs before

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Noble (but with higher DEX, she's not soft)
**AC**: 12 | **HP**: 15
**Notable Abilities**: Carries a concealed dagger, knows how to use it

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Primary quest, Vendrath Holdings faction, possible connection to Guild through backstory
**Potential Uses**:
- Provides the initial quest hook and ongoing employment
- Can supply gold, information, and access to her network
- Her warehouse is the first crime scene
- Her connection to the Guild could help the party gain their trust

## GM Notes

Lysara is the party's anchor to the "normal" world - a reliable patron in a city of corruption. Don't make her secretly evil or connected to the cult. Her purpose is to give the party a trustworthy employer so the betrayals and corruption elsewhere hit harder.

She'll pay what she promised and won't betray the party. She might ask them to do morally grey things (that's her business), but she'll be honest about what she's asking and why.

If the party keeps her informed, she becomes more useful - arranging meetings, providing resources, using her network. If they cut her out, she'll pursue her own investigation and might stumble into danger the party has to rescue her from.

Her friendship with Nine-Fingers is a card she won't play unless desperate - it would reveal too much about her past. But if the party needs a Guild introduction and has earned her trust, she can provide it.
