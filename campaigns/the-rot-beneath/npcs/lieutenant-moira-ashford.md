## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Occupation** | Flaming Fist Officer (Lower City Commander) |
| **Age** | Mid 30s |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A broad-shouldered woman with sun-darkened skin and close-cropped brown hair starting to show grey at the temples. She has the build of someone who trained with sword and shield and still drills regularly. A scar runs along her jawline from a street fight years ago. Her uniform is always clean but worn at the edges - she can't afford a new one on her salary, and she won't take bribes for one.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Tired but determined - she hasn't given up yet, but she's running on fumes
**Motivation**: Actually protect the people of the Lower City, do the job she signed up for
**Fear**: Becoming like the corrupt officers she despises, giving up

**Personality Traits**:
- Genuinely believes in justice, which makes her rare in the Flaming Fist
- Stubborn to a fault - won't let go of a problem
- Terrible at politics - too honest for her own good

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Direct, military cadence. Swears under her breath when frustrated. Speaks louder when she's trying to convince herself of something.
**Mannerisms**: Rubs the scar on her jaw when thinking. Stands at parade rest out of habit. Keeps her hand near her sword hilt in unfamiliar situations.
**Sample Dialogue**: "I've filed twelve reports on this. Twelve. They keep getting 'lost in processing.' Tell me that's coincidence."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- Strange illnesses spreading through the Lower City
- Vendrath Holdings and other businesses have filed complaints
- The Fist's official position is "disease, not crime"

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- Her reports keep disappearing - someone high up is burying them
- The sick aren't just sick - she's seen them, they're hollow somehow
- Sergeant Thane specifically reassigned her investigation to "lower priority"
- Three of her people went into the sewers investigating a tip and only one came back - wrong

### Secrets (GM only)
- She suspects Thane specifically but has no proof
- She's been conducting an unofficial investigation on her own time
- She found a hollow charm on one of the sick workers and has it hidden at home
- She's close to being transferred or forced out for asking too many questions

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Suspicious but hopeful - she needs allies and is afraid to trust the wrong people
**Current Disposition**: Cautious (if approached)
**History with Party**: None

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Veteran
**AC**: 17 (chain mail, shield) | **HP**: 58
**Notable Abilities**: Action Surge (once), fighting style (defense)

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Flaming Fist faction, exposing Sergeant Thane, possible Fist support in finale
**Potential Uses**:
- Can share official information and her unofficial investigation
- Knows Sergeant Thane is compromised (suspects, not proves)
- Could mobilize Fist resources if given proof of the cult
- The hollow charm she found is a valuable clue

## GM Notes

Lieutenant Ashford is the **good cop in a corrupt system** - proof that not everyone in the Flaming Fist is compromised, but also showing how hard it is to do the right thing when the system is against you.

**Building trust with her:**
- Share information openly (she's starved for allies)
- Bring evidence she can actually use
- Don't ask her to break Fist regulations without good reason
- Acknowledge the risk she's taking

**What she can provide:**
- Official access the party can't get on their own
- Information about Fist operations and Thane's interference
- The hollow charm she found (a major clue)
- Eventually, Fist backup if the party helps her expose Thane

**Her arc:** If the party helps her expose Thane, she could become a powerful ally commanding Fist resources. If they fail or alienate her, she'll likely be transferred or worse, and that ally is lost.

She's also at risk - if Thane realizes she's investigating him, the cult might target her. She could become someone the party needs to protect.
