**Role**: Antagonist (Compromised Official)
**Location**: Flaming Fist headquarters, or wherever investigations need to be suppressed
**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Occupation** | Flaming Fist Sergeant (Investigation Division) |
| **Age** | Late 40s |
| **Status** | Alive |

## Appearance

A heavyset man running to fat, with thinning red hair and a face that was probably handsome before drink and stress bloated it. His uniform is expensive - too expensive for his rank - and he wears gold rings on three fingers. His eyes are bloodshot and he sweats more than the weather warrants. He looks like a man who hasn't slept well in months.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Blustering, defensive, using aggression to cover fear
**Motivation**: Survival - covering his crimes, protecting himself from the cult
**Fear**: Being exposed, what the cult will do if he stops being useful

**Personality Traits**:
- Coward who uses his position as a shield
- Once had principles, buried them long ago under compromises
- Desperately trying to convince himself he's still in control

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Loud, talks over people, asks aggressive questions to put them on defensive. When rattled, his voice goes higher and faster.
**Mannerisms**: Mops his face with a handkerchief constantly. Jingling the coins in his pocket. Won't meet eyes for long when lying.
**Sample Dialogue**: "You want to file a report? Fine, file it. I've got a stack of reports that high - yours will get handled when it gets handled. Now get out of my office."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- He's in charge of investigating "sensitive matters" in the Lower City
- He's expensive - everyone knows he takes bribes
- He's connected - complaints against him go nowhere

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- He won't share anything willingly - he's too scared of both exposure and the cult

### Secrets (GM only)
- The cult has evidence of a murder he committed fifteen years ago - killed a man in a gambling dispute, covered it up
- He doesn't know the full scope of the cult's activities - he thinks he's covering for corrupt nobles, not an apocalyptic plot
- He's been suppressing investigations for eight months
- He's been drinking himself to sleep every night and is deteriorating
- Part of him wants to be caught - he can't live like this much longer

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Hostile obstruction - he'll try to intimidate them away from investigating
**Current Disposition**: Enemy (will actively interfere with their work)
**History with Party**: Will become aware of them quickly once they start investigating

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Veteran (but out of shape, disadvantage on CON saves)
**AC**: 16 (chain mail) | **HP**: 45 (should be 58 but he's unfit)
**Notable Abilities**: None special - he's a bureaucrat now, not a fighter

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: Flaming Fist faction, cult cover-up, potentially flipping him for information
**Potential Uses**:
- Major obstacle to official investigation
- If exposed, removes cult's Fist protection
- Could potentially be flipped if the party offers protection or plays on his guilt
- His breakdown could provide dramatic moment and information

## GM Notes

Thane is a **weak point** in the cult's operation - not a true believer, just a coward caught in blackmail. He can be:

**Confronted**: If the party gets evidence against him, he might crack. He's terrified of the cult, but he's also exhausted by living in fear. Offering him protection (or threatening worse exposure) might flip him.

**Exposed**: Bringing his corruption to light (to Ravengard, to the Parliament, to the public) removes the cult's Fist protection and potentially gains Lieutenant Ashford's full trust and resources.

**Observed**: Following him might lead to cult contacts.

**Key moment**: If truly cornered, Thane will break down. He never wanted this. He made one terrible choice fifteen years ago and has been paying for it ever since. He might beg for help, confess everything, and become a reluctant informant - or he might try to fight his way out and die. Depending on how the party handles it.

He doesn't know about The Absence or the Great Emptying. He knows there's a cult, he knows they're "hollowing" people, and he knows some Peers are involved. That's enough to be very useful if extracted.
