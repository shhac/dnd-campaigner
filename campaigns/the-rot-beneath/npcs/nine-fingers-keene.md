## Appearance

A compact woman with a fighter's build gone slightly soft, dark skin weathered by years of hard living. Her left hand is missing four fingers - only the thumb remains - the result of a punishment that failed to break her and instead made her legend. She dresses well but practically, favoring dark colors that don't show stains. Her eyes are her most striking feature: patient and calculating, like a cat watching a mouse hole.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Patient, measured, dangerously calm - she doesn't need to raise her voice
**Motivation**: Control her territory, protect her people, maintain the order that keeps everyone profitable
**Fear**: Chaos, the unpredictable, forces she can't negotiate with or kill

**Personality Traits**:
- Respects competence and nerve above all else
- Rewards loyalty absolutely and punishes betrayal absolutely
- Believes in rules - even criminals need them, or everything falls apart

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Slow, deliberate speech. Never rushes. Asks questions she already knows the answers to, testing honesty. Occasional dark humor.
**Mannerisms**: Taps her remaining thumb against surfaces when thinking. Sits with her back to the wall. Never touches food or drink until someone else has.
**Sample Dialogue**: "See, this is what I appreciate about you. You're smart enough to know you need something, and smart enough to not waste my time pretending you don't."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- Nothing - publicly, Nine-Fingers doesn't exist, and the Guild is a rumor

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- The Guild is losing people in the sewers - not to violence, but to something that leaves them... wrong
- Something has moved into tunnels the Guild has used for years
- The rot spreading through the Lower City isn't natural
- The Flaming Fist is actively not investigating, which means someone paid them not to

### Secrets (GM only)
- She knows Lysara Vendrath from childhood - they grew up on the same streets before their paths diverged
- She's seen a hollowed up close - one of her people who came back empty - and had to kill her herself
- She's genuinely frightened for the first time in decades, though she'd never show it
- She's considering whether to abandon the sewers entirely, but that would cripple Guild operations

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Cautious interest - she'll assess whether they're useful or a threat
**Current Disposition**: Unknown (haven't met yet)
**History with Party**: None, but she's heard someone is poking around the Vendrath situation

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Assassin (reduced, she's past her prime but still dangerous)
**AC**: 15 (leather armor) | **HP**: 65
**Notable Abilities**: Sneak Attack, expertise in Perception and Insight, always has an escape route

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: The Guild faction, sewer navigation, potential alliance against the cult
**Potential Uses**:
- Can provide maps and guides through the sewers
- Guild intelligence network can reveal cult activities
- Alliance with the Guild gives the party resources and backup
- Her personal knowledge of the hollowed provides information

## GM Notes

Nine-Fingers is a **potential major ally** - possibly the most powerful ally available to the party in terms of resources and manpower. But she needs to be convinced.

**What convinces her:**
- Information about what's actually happening (she hates not knowing)
- Demonstrated competence (surviving the sewers earns respect)
- Honesty (she can smell lies, don't bother)
- Mutual benefit (she's practical, show her how helping them helps her)

**What alienates her:**
- Disrespect or condescension
- Working with Flaming Fist against the Guild
- Lying to her face
- Treating her people as expendable

If the party earns her trust, she'll provide Wiven Mirsk as a guide, share intelligence, and potentially send Guild members to help in the finale. If they make an enemy of her, the sewers become much more dangerous.

Her connection to Lysara is leverage - if either woman learns the party knows about their shared past, it could build trust or create problems, depending on how it's handled.
