## Appearance

A gaunt man who might have been vital once, now seemingly hollowed himself - though he insists he's more full than he ever was. His skin is pale grey, stretched tight over sharp bones. His eyes are the strangest thing: not empty like the hollowed, but somehow too deep, as if there's more darkness behind them than a skull should hold. He wears grey robes that were once a priest's vestments, all holy symbols removed, and his voice echoes slightly even in small rooms.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Serene, genuinely peaceful - he believes absolutely in what he's doing
**Motivation**: End suffering by ending everything that can suffer
**Fear**: Nothing - he's already given everything to The Absence. Fear requires something to lose.

**Personality Traits**:
- Terrifyingly rational about his philosophy
- Kind in manner even while doing monstrous things
- Remembers who he was and considers that person unenlightened, not wrong

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Soft, measured, never raised. Speaks of the void with gentle reverence. Uses medical language for hollowing - "treatment," "relief," "peace."
**Mannerisms**: Moves slowly, deliberately. Often closes his eyes when speaking, as if listening to something. Touches people gently on the shoulder or head.
**Sample Dialogue**: "You're suffering. I can see it in you - the noise, the wanting, the fear. I'm offering you quiet. True quiet. Isn't that what you've always wanted, in your worst moments? To simply... stop?"

### Secrets (GM only)
- He was a devoted priest of Kelemvor until his wife and two children died of plague
- His faith broke, and in the silence of his grief, something answered
- The Absence is real, but even Veris doesn't fully understand what it is
- He genuinely loves his followers and believes he's saving them
- There's a fragment of his old self still present - it might be reachable

## Relationship to Party

## GM Notes

Veris is a **tragic villain** - a good man broken by grief who found comfort in oblivion and now wants to share that "gift" with everyone. He's not cackling evil; he's soft-spoken evil that genuinely believes it's doing good.

**What makes him effective:**
- He's not wrong that suffering is real and terrible
- His offer of peace is tempting to those who are hurting
- He was good once, and some of that shows
- He won't lie or manipulate - he believes truth serves his cause

**His vulnerability:**
- Memories of his family - he still carries a locket with their picture
- Genuine questions about what The Absence actually wants
- His old faith - Kelemvor's teachings about death being transition, not ending
- The part of him that would be horrified if he could see clearly

**Possible outcomes:**
1. Killed in combat - standard villain defeat
2. The Absence is banished and he's left empty, finally getting the oblivion he wanted
3. Somehow redeemed - broken free of The Absence's influence, forced to live with what he's done
4. Escapes to become a recurring threat

His relationship with The Absence is unclear even to him. Is he a servant? A prophet? A puppet? A collaborator? The answer might matter in the finale.
