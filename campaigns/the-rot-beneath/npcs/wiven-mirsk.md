**Role**: Potential Ally (Guild Guide)

**Campaign**: The Rot Beneath

## Quick Reference

| | |
|---|---|
| **Race** | Human |
| **Occupation** | Guild Hand (Sewer Operations) |
| **Age** | 60s |

## Appearance

A wiry old man with a permanent squint from decades in dark tunnels and skin the color of old parchment. He's missing two teeth and most of his left ear (rats, he says, but he's lying - it was a knife fight). His clothes are practical and waterproof, stained with things best not examined. He moves through the sewers like water through pipes - naturally, without thought.

## Personality

**Demeanor**: Laconic, patient, quietly amused by surface-dwellers' discomfort underground
**Motivation**: Survival, protecting his territory, and eventually dying of old age rather than whatever's in the tunnels
**Fear**: The hollowed - he's seen them, and they're wrong in ways he can't explain

**Personality Traits**:
- Knows every tunnel, every shortcut, every danger in the sewers
- Doesn't talk much but listens to everything
- Respects competence and nerve - you earn his help, you don't buy it

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Speech Pattern**: Short sentences, long pauses. Heavy Lower City accent. Uses sewer-specific slang that requires translation.
**Mannerisms**: Constantly checking sight lines and exits. Touches the walls as he walks, feeling for changes. Sniffs the air for danger.
**Sample Dialogue**: "You want to go *there*? Yeah. Yeah, I can take you. But when I say run, you run. No questions, no heroics. You run or you're on your own."

## What They Know

### Public Knowledge
- Nothing - publicly, Wiven doesn't exist

### Private Knowledge (requires trust/persuasion)
- Complete knowledge of Guild-mapped sewer territory
- Where the dangerous areas are, and which dangers are new
- The locations where Guild members have disappeared
- Safe routes through most of the underground

### Secrets (GM only)
- He's seen a hollowed up close - it was his nephew. He had to leave him behind.
- He knows approximately where the cult's territory begins but won't go there alone
- The sewers have been changing - new passages opening, old ones collapsing. Something is reshaping them.
- He suspects the old Bhaal temple is down there somewhere, based on architecture he's glimpsed

## Relationship to Party

**First Impression**: Skeptical - surface-dwellers don't last long underground
**Current Disposition**: Neutral (hasn't met them yet)
**History with Party**: None

## Combat Stats (if needed)

**Use Stat Block**: Scout
**AC**: 13 (leather) | **HP**: 33
**Notable Abilities**: Expertise in Stealth and Survival, darkvision from a magic ring (Guild equipment)

## Plot Relevance

**Connected To**: The Guild, sewer navigation, approaching the cult's sanctum
**Potential Uses**:
- Essential guide through the sewers
- Source of practical information about the underground
- Can identify signs of cult activity
- His personal stake (his nephew) adds emotional weight

## GM Notes

Wiven is a **practical ally** - not a fighter, not a leader, but indispensable for navigating the sewers. Without him (or someone like him), the party will get lost, walk into traps, or stumble into the cult unprepared.

**Earning his help:**
- Nine-Fingers must approve (or the party must impress him independently)
- Treating him with respect, not as a servant
- Demonstrating they can handle themselves underground
- Sharing information about what took his nephew

**What he provides:**
- Safe passage through Guild territory
- Maps and route planning
- Warning of dangers (rats, oozes, cave-ins, worse)
- Knowledge of sewer "culture" - what's normal, what's new

**His limit:**
He'll guide them to the edge of cult territory. He won't go into the Hollow Heart. Too many people have gone in and not come out, or come out wrong. If the party wants a guide all the way, they'll need to find another way or convince him his nephew might still be saved.

**His nephew** is still down there - hollowed but not gone. This is a potential story hook: if the Remembrance Bell exists and works, could they save Wiven's nephew? The old man won't ask, but he'll hope.
