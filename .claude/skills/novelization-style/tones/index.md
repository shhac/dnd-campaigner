# Narrative Tones

Tones define the emotional texture and thematic emphasis of your campaign's narrative. While style controls *how* prose is constructed, tone controls *what feeling* that prose evokes.

## Available Tones

| Tone | Best For | Key Characteristics |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| **Gritty Noir** | Urban intrigue, morally complex campaigns, survival horror | Cynical observations, world-weary protagonists, moral ambiguity, consequences matter |
| **Heroic Adventure** | Classic fantasy, epic quests, good vs evil | Valor and courage, triumphant moments, camaraderie, wonder and discovery |
| **Literary Drama** | Character-driven campaigns, political intrigue, personal stakes | Psychological depth, relationship focus, thematic resonance, internal conflict |

## Matching Tone to Campaign

Consider your campaign's core themes when selecting a tone:

- **Gritty Noir** works when choices have costs, when heroes are flawed, when the world pushes back. Urban settings, crime, corruption, survival against the odds.

- **Heroic Adventure** shines in campaigns about becoming heroes, facing legendary threats, and experiencing the wonder of a magical world. Classic dungeon crawls, dragon slaying, world-saving.

- **Literary Drama** excels when characters and their relationships matter most. Political maneuvering, family secrets, personal redemption arcs, campaigns where combat is rare but meaningful.

## Usage Guidelines

**Load only ONE tone at a time.** Tones are mutually exclusive by design. A campaign written in gritty noir should not suddenly shift to heroic adventure mid-session without deliberate reason.

Tone can evolve across a campaign arc. A story might begin as heroic adventure, then shift to literary drama as characters face personal costs, and finally adopt gritty noir when the world darkens. Such transitions should be intentional and gradual.

When the GM agent loads a tone, it should influence:
- Word choice and vocabulary
- What details receive narrative focus
- How emotions are expressed (or suppressed)
- The balance between hope and cynicism
- What constitutes a satisfying scene

Tone pairs with style to create complete narrative voice. A pulp-paced gritty noir reads differently than a measured-pace gritty noir, though both share the same emotional palette.
