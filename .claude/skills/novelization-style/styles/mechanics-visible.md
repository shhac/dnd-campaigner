# Mechanics-Visible Style

D&D mechanics are shown or implied within the prose, creating a LitRPG or GameLit reading experience.

This style maintains narrative flow while preserving the mechanical texture of the game. Readers familiar with D&D will recognize abilities, appreciate critical hits, and understand the stakes of saving throws.

## Formatting Rules

Follows the same chapter structure, scene breaks (`* * *`), and paragraphing as fantasy-novel style, with the addition of mechanical asides.

### Mechanical Asides

Use parenthetical notes sparingly for clarity:
- Spell names and levels: `(Cure Wounds, 2nd level)`
- Significant abilities: `(Action Surge)`
- Class features in action: `(Sneak Attack)`

Avoid cluttering every sentence. Reserve parentheticals for:
- Named abilities readers might want to remember
- Moments where the mechanic enhances understanding
- Callbacks to character builds and choices

## Handling Combat

Combat can reference the mechanical layer while maintaining narrative momentum.

**Acceptable references:**
- Round structure (when dramatically appropriate)
- Specific ability and spell names
- Turn order (if it creates tension)
- Hit points as abstract vitality ("She could take maybe one more hit like that")

**Example:**
> The hobgoblin captain raised its shield, but Aldric was faster. His blade found the gap between helmet and gorget—a critical hit that sent the creature staggering. Before it could recover, he pressed the advantage (Action Surge), his second attack driving deep into its side.
>
> Twelve seconds. That's how long the battle had lasted. Two rounds, and the patrol was finished.

**Keep narrative priority.** Mechanics enhance the story; they don't replace it. A fight described as "I attack, I hit, 8 damage" is a transcript, not a novelization.

## Handling Dialogue

Same approach as fantasy-novel style. Dialogue should remain natural—characters don't speak in game terms unless it fits their personality (a battle-hardened mercenary might say "I can take another hit or two" but wouldn't say "I have 23 hit points remaining").

Exception: Characters discussing tactics might reference abilities by name.

> "Save your Channel Divinity," Kira said. "We'll need it for whatever's behind that door."
>
> Tilda nodded, checking her remaining daggers. "I've got one more Sneak Attack in me if I can get behind it."

## Handling Ability Checks and Saves

Mechanics can be implied or stated, depending on dramatic needs.

**Implied mechanics:**
> She prayed to her goddess and felt divine energy flow through her hands (Cure Wounds, 2nd level), knitting flesh and easing pain. Not enough to restore him fully, but enough to get him back on his feet.

**Stated mechanics (for dramatic emphasis):**
> The poison burned through his veins. Constitution save. He'd seen enough adventurers fall to know this was the moment—pass or die. His body seized, fighting the venom with everything it had.
>
> He passed. Barely.

**Critical moments:**
> Her arrow flew true—more than true. A critical hit. The shaft buried itself in the giant's eye, and the creature's roar became a gurgle as it toppled forward like a felled oak.

## When to Use This Style

This style serves readers who:
- Want to remember how their sessions played out mechanically
- Enjoy LitRPG and GameLit as genres
- Are learning D&D and benefit from seeing mechanics in narrative context
- Take pride in their character builds and want those choices visible

It's also useful for:
- Tutorial novelizations teaching new players
- Session summaries meant for player reference
- Groups who enjoy the game-within-story aesthetic

## Example Passage

**Session Notes:**
> Kira casts Spiritual Weapon (bonus action) and attacks with it (hits, 8 force damage). Uses remaining action to cast Toll the Dead (Wisdom save failed, 12 necrotic damage). The specter retaliates, hitting Kira for 10 necrotic damage.

**Mechanics-Visible Style:**
> Kira's prayer took shape in the air beside her—a spectral mace wrought of pure divine will (Spiritual Weapon). It swung in a shimmering arc, connecting with the specter's ethereal form and tearing a howl from its throat.
>
> She wasn't finished. Her voice rose in a death knell (Toll the Dead), and the sound itself became a weapon, vibrating through the creature's essence. It writhed, dark energy bleeding from wounds that existed in no physical sense—twelve points of necrotic damage that left it flickering like a candle in the wind.
>
> But the dead did not die easily. The specter's claws raked through her shoulder, and Kira gasped as cold flooded her body. Ten hit points, just like that. She could feel her life force draining, her warmth feeding the creature's hatred.
>
> *Two more hits like that,* she thought grimly, *and I join them in undeath.*
