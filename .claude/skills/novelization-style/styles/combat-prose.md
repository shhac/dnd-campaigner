# Combat Prose Guidelines

Load this file **in addition to** your chosen base style (fantasy-novel or mechanics-visible) when novelizing action-heavy chapters.

This guide addresses the core challenge of combat novelization: D&D combat is turn-based and granular, but good action prose flows like choreography.

## When to Go Blow-by-Blow vs Summary

Not all combat deserves equal page time. Match narrative weight to dramatic importance.

### Use Blow-by-Blow For:
- **Boss fights**: The antagonist they've been building toward
- **Character death scenes**: When a PC or beloved NPC falls
- **Turning points**: The moment the tide shifts, for good or ill
- **Dramatic duels**: One-on-one confrontations with personal stakes
- **Desperate last stands**: When survival itself is uncertain

### Use Summary For:
- **Mook fights**: Dispatching minions on the way to the real threat
- **Overwhelming victories**: When the party is clearly outmatching foes
- **Retreats and escapes**: Combat as obstacle, not centerpiece
- **Routine encounters**: Random encounters that didn't become memorable

**Summary Example:**
> The goblin patrol never stood a chance. Tilda moved through them like a shadow with a blade, and within thirty seconds, it was over—five bodies on the stone floor, not one of them having landed a blow. She cleaned her dagger on the nearest corpse and kept moving.

## Compressing Multiple Rounds

A single round of D&D combat represents six seconds. A five-round fight is thirty seconds of in-world action. Prose should feel appropriately compressed.

### Techniques for Compression:

**Group similar actions:**
> They exchanged blows, testing each other's defenses, neither finding an opening.

**Expand only pivotal moments:**
> Three rounds of dancing around each other ended when Aldric saw his chance—the orc captain's shield dropped a fraction too low...

**Use time language:**
> Minutes felt like hours. Later, none of them could say exactly how long the battle lasted.
> The fight was over before she could draw her second breath.

**Montage repeated actions:**
> Again and again she loosed arrows, watching them strike home, watching the creatures keep coming anyway.

## Making Dice Feel Organic

Dice rolls create drama at the table. In prose, translate that drama into sensory experience and stakes.

### Near-Misses (attacks that missed by narrow margins):
> The blade whistled past, close enough to shave the stubble from his chin.
> Her spell splashed against the wall an inch from the vampire's face—so close she could see its mocking smile.
> The arrow parted his hair before embedding in the doorframe behind him.

### Lucky Hits (attacks that hit against the odds):
> Through sheer luck or divine intervention, her dagger found the gap between the plates—the one weakness in the creature's armor.
> He shouldn't have connected. The angle was wrong, his footing poor. But his blade found flesh anyway, and he wasn't about to question it.

### Critical Hits (maximum impact moments):
> Time slowed as she realized this strike would end it—one way or another. Every muscle aligned, every instinct harmonized, and she drove her sword home with the full weight of her fury.
> The blow landed perfectly. Devastatingly. The kind of strike warriors told stories about.

### Failed Saves (when the dice betray you):
> She felt the magic trying to take hold, fought it with everything she had—and lost. Her limbs locked. Her voice froze. She could only watch, helpless, as the enemy advanced.

### Successful Saves (narrow survival):
> The fire washed over him. By all rights, he should have burned. But something—training, stubbornness, blind luck—let him twist away from the worst of it, emerging singed but alive.

## Party Coordination

Combat involving multiple characters needs choreography. Show the party working as a unit.

### Tactical Communication:
> "Left flank!" Aldric shouted, and Tilda was already moving, their years of fighting together translating intent into action.

> Kira caught his eye and tilted her head—their signal. He dropped to one knee as her Sacred Flame roared over his head into the creature behind him.

> No words passed between them, but none were needed. After three months on the road, they fought like a single organism with four bodies.

### Interleaving Actions:
Don't resolve one character's actions completely before moving to the next. Cut between party members to create momentum:

> Tilda's blade opened the orc's guard just as Aldric's sword found its throat. Kira's prayer finished a heartbeat later, and golden light sealed the wounds they'd taken in the exchange.

### Building to Coordinated Moments:
Set up combination attacks with narrative momentum:

> "Get it off balance!" Kira shouted. Aldric threw himself at the troll's knees while Tilda slashed at its reaching arms. The creature stumbled, swayed—
>
> —and Kira's Guiding Bolt struck it square in the chest, divine radiance igniting the oil Tilda had splashed across it moments before.

## Injury and Consequence Pacing

Hit points are abstract. Prose consequences should not be.

### Don't Enumerate HP:
**Avoid:** "He had 5 hit points left."
**Write:** "Blood loss made his movements sluggish, each parry coming slower than the last. One more hit would finish him."

### Show Accumulating Wear:
Early fight:
> The blade scored a line across his forearm—first blood, but far from last.

Mid fight:
> Another wound joined the collection. He was beginning to lose track of where he was bleeding.

Late fight:
> Every breath burned. His sword weighed a thousand pounds. Only spite was keeping him upright now.

### Injuries Should Affect Performance:
> She tried to raise her shield arm and screamed as the broken bone shifted. Defense was no longer an option—only attack, only ending this before her body failed completely.

### Death Saves as Tension:
> He lay in the mud, watching his blood pool beneath him. The sounds of battle seemed distant now. This was it, then. This was how it ended.
>
> Except... no. His heart was still beating. Each thump surprised him, but it kept coming. Not dead yet. Not quite.

## Magic in Combat

Spellcasting transforms combat from steel-on-steel to something stranger and more wondrous. Magic should feel like power—beautiful, terrible, and costly.

### Spellcasting as Sensory Experience

Every spell should assault the senses. Evocation magic is raw force—heat that sears the skin from twenty feet away, lightning that leaves the taste of copper in everyone's mouth, thunder that vibrates in the chest long after the sound fades. Necromancy feels *wrong*—a cold that has nothing to do with temperature, a pulling sensation like something vital being drawn out through the skin. Enchantment is subtler: a sudden fog behind the eyes, thoughts that feel slippery, the uncomfortable sense of puppet strings being attached.

Verbal components aren't just words—they're incantations that hurt to hear, syllables that seem to bend the air, phrases that echo longer than they should. Somatic components are dance and ritual: fingers tracing patterns that leave afterimages, stances that seem to root the caster to something deeper than stone.

> She spoke three words in a language that predated human tongues, and fire answered.

### Spell Slots Without Mentioning Them

Early in combat, magic flows freely. Spells are cast with confidence, almost casual displays of power. But as the fight wears on, the caster becomes more selective, choosing moments with care.

Late in battle, desperation shows. "One more" becomes a prayer. The magic that felt bottomless now scrapes the edges of something finite.

> She reached for the Weave and found less waiting than before. The well was running dry.

> The spell left him gasping, hollowed out. He could feel how few remained.

After that final casting, show the cost—trembling hands, unfocused eyes, the exhaustion of having poured too much of yourself into the fight.

### Concentration as Dramatic Tension

Maintaining a spell under fire is warfare on two fronts. Show the caster's divided attention—the flicker in their eyes as they track both the spell's effect and the blade coming for their throat. When damage lands, describe the spell wavering, guttering like a candle in wind.

> The troll's club caught her shoulder, and for a terrible moment, Kira felt her prayer slipping away. She clutched the holy symbol harder, forcing her will to hold, feeling the *Bless* straining against her breaking concentration.

When concentration finally fails, describe what stops—the protective shimmer winking out, the creature returning to wherever it was summoned from, the enemy's frozen limbs suddenly mobile again.

### Reaction Spells

*Counterspell* and *Shield* create moments of desperate improvisation. The caster sees magic forming and has a heartbeat to respond.

> She saw the flames gathering in his palm and spoke a word that unwove them. The fire died before it was born, leaving only a faint shimmer of heat in the air between them.

> The sword descended, and he threw up a hand on pure instinct. Silver light bloomed inches from his face, and the blade rang against something that hadn't existed a moment before.

These are not planned actions—they're reflexes that cost something, split-second gambles that leave the caster breathing hard.

### Area Effects and Multi-Target

When magic sweeps across a battlefield, show its passage like weather. The *Fireball* doesn't just explode—it rolls outward, catching friend and foe alike in its hungry light. Different targets react differently: the trained soldier diving clear, the mindless undead walking straight into annihilation, the clever enemy who saw it coming and moved a heartbeat too late.

From the caster's perspective, there's the terrible god's-eye-view of destruction they've unleashed.

> She watched the lightning arc from orc to orc, each one jerking like a marionette before crumpling. Six dead in the time it took to speak the spell. Power, and the weight that came with it.

### Summoned Creatures

Conjured allies fight, but they're extensions of will, not characters. Describe their actions as the caster's intent made manifest—the wolf that appears knows exactly where to bite because its summoner knows where the enemy is weakest.

> The spectral hound harried the cultist's flank, driving him back toward Aldric's waiting blade. Kira's will guided it like a hunting falcon—never quite independent, never quite her.

When the magic ends, summoned creatures don't die—they simply stop being. One moment present, the next remembered. The fade can be peaceful or violent, depending on how the spell ended.

## Example Passages

### Blow-by-Blow: Boss Fight

> The Wraith King raised one skeletal hand, and the temperature plummeted. Frost crept across the flagstones toward Aldric's boots.
>
> "Now!" he roared, and charged.
>
> His blade passed through the creature's form, but met resistance—the cold itself seemed solid, and the Wraith King shrieked as silver fire traced the wound. Divine magic. The enchantment was holding.
>
> The counterattack came faster than death. Spectral claws raked across Aldric's breastplate, and the cold that followed nearly stopped his heart. He staggered, gasping, as his vision went gray at the edges.
>
> Kira's prayer hit the Wraith King from behind, golden light that made it writhe and twist. It spun toward her, momentarily forgetting Aldric—
>
> —which was exactly what Tilda needed. She came out of the shadows like a blade herself, her enchanted dagger finding the seam where the creature's crown met its skull. The Wraith King convulsed, its shriek becoming something almost human, almost pitiable.
>
> "Together!" Aldric brought his sword up. Kira raised her holy symbol. Tilda twisted her blade.
>
> The Wraith King of Hallowmere died for the second time, and this time, it would not return.

### Summary: Routine Encounter

> They found the bandits exactly where the farmer had said they would be—a dozen rough men camped in the old mill, too drunk on stolen wine to post a proper watch.
>
> The fight, if it could be called that, lasted less than a minute. Tilda disabled their leader before he could draw steel. Aldric disarmed three more with the flat of his blade, demonstrating clearly what the edge could do if they resisted. Kira stood in the doorway, holy symbol gleaming, making it clear that divine wrath awaited anyone who fled.
>
> They left the bandits bound and groaning, their stolen goods recovered, and were back on the road by noon. Just another day's work.
