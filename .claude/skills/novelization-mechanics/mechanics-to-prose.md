# Handling Mechanics in Prose

The cardinal rule: **Never mention dice, rolls, HP, AC, or game mechanics.** Translate everything into embodied, sensory experience.

## Combat

- Never mention dice, rolls, HP, or AC
- Describe the fiction, not the mechanics
- Show the action through physical description

**Good**: "Her blade found the gap in his armor, and he staggered back with a gasp"
**Bad**: "She rolled a 19 and hit for 12 damage"

## Ability Checks

- Show the attempt and result through action
- Let the outcome speak through physical description
- Include the character's internal experience when appropriate

**Good**: "The lock resisted her picks, then clicked open with a satisfying snick"
**Bad**: "She succeeded on her Dexterity check"

**Good**: "His fingers slipped on the wet stone, but he caught himself at the last moment"
**Bad**: "He barely made the Athletics check"

## Spells

- Describe effects evocatively with sensory detail
- Use proper spell names when characters would know them
- Show the cost (components, concentration) when dramatic
- Let magic feel wondrous or terrible, not routine

**Good**: "Seraphine spoke the words of power, and silver light erupted from her palm, washing over the wounded fighter"
**Bad**: "She cast Cure Wounds"

## Damage and Injury

- Describe wounds proportionally to their severity
- A critical hit should feel impactful in prose
- Near-death should read as desperate
- Minor hits can be glancing blows or near-misses that still connect

| Mechanical Severity | Prose Treatment |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Minor damage | Stinging cut, bruise, glancing blow |
| Moderate damage | Serious wound, blood flowing, pain evident |
| Heavy damage | Devastating strike, character reeling, survival in doubt |
| Near-death | Desperate, fading, clinging to consciousness |

## Translating Degrees of Success

For detailed outcome mapping (natural 20s, natural 1s, etc.), see the "Translating Degrees of Success and Failure" section in `novelization-style`. That table provides nuanced prose treatments for:

- Critical success (nat 20): Effortless, elegant, impressive
- Success by wide margin: Confident, controlled
- Success by narrow margin: Tense, close call, relief
- Failure by narrow margin: Almost had it, frustrating
- Failure by wide margin: Clear incompetence or overwhelming opposition
- Critical failure (nat 1): Comedic or catastrophic

## Edge Cases

### Character Death
- **POV character death**: End chapter with their final thought/sensation
- **Dramatic death**: Give proper farewell beats, let companions react
- **Surprise death**: Brief and shocking, impact comes from abruptness

### Sparse Sources
If decision-log is thin for a chapter:
- Lean heavier on journals for emotional content
- Use more atmospheric/transitional prose
- Note the gap in your return status

### Voice Consistency
- **Chapter 1**: Establish voice from character sheet + tone guidance
- **Chapter 2+**: Match the established voice from previous chapter(s)
