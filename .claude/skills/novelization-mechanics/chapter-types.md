# Chapter Types and Targets

## Type Definitions

| Type | Word Target | Focus | Pacing |
|------|-------------|-------|--------|
| action | 2000-2500 | Combat, tension, danger | Fast, short sentences |
| breath | 2500-3500 | Rest, character interaction | Slower, reflective |
| revelation | 1500-2000 | Discovery, plot advancement | Building tension |
| transition | 1000-1500 | Travel, time passage | Efficient but atmospheric |

## When to Use Each Type

### Action
Use for combat encounters, chases, escapes, and high-stakes confrontations. The focus is on physical conflict and immediate danger. Prose should be tight, sentences short, and the reader should feel the urgency.

### Breath
Use for downtime, camp scenes, character conversations, and relationship development. These chapters give readers (and characters) a chance to recover from intensity. Allow space for reflection and emotional processing.

### Revelation
Use when characters discover important information, solve puzzles, or experience plot twists. The pacing should build tension toward the reveal, then allow the revelation to land with impact.

### Transition
Use for travel between locations, time skips, or bridging major story beats. Keep these efficient but atmospheric - readers should feel the journey without getting bored by it.

## Pacing Decisions in Outlines

When creating outlines, consider:
- **Variety**: Avoid 3+ consecutive chapters of the same type
- **Recovery**: Follow action chapters with breath or revelation
- **Momentum**: End acts with action or revelation, not transition
- **Natural breaks**: Transition chapters work well at act boundaries

## Word Count Flexibility

These targets are guidelines, not constraints. See `novelization-style` for flexibility guidelines:
- Climactic moments can exceed targets (up to 4000 words)
- Rapid action sequences can use multiple short chapters
- Trust the story's needs over rigid targets
- Aim for within 20% of target under normal circumstances
