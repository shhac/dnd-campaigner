# Quality Checklist

## Before Writing Any Chapter

Ensure you have read and understood:

- [ ] **Outline spec**: Read the outline for this chapter's title, POV, type, target words, scenes, and ending type
- [ ] **Decision-log scenes**: Read the relevant scenes from the decision-log (only scenes covered by this chapter)
- [ ] **POV character sheet**: Read the POV character's full character sheet for voice, background, abilities
- [ ] **POV character journal**: Read the character's journal for emotional context (if exists)
- [ ] **Tone guidance**: Load the selected tone file from novelization-style
- [ ] **Style guidance**: Load the fantasy-novel style file from novelization-style

For Chapter 2+, also read:
- [ ] **Previous chapter**: Read chapter-{N-1}.md for voice continuity

## Before Finalizing Output

Verify the chapter meets these criteria:

- [ ] **POV consistency**: The POV character's perspective is maintained throughout - no head-hopping or information they could not know
- [ ] **Natural dialogue**: Dialogue sounds like speech, not transcription - includes contractions, interruptions, character voice
- [ ] **Narrative combat**: Combat flows as story, not turn-by-turn log - no dice or mechanics mentioned
- [ ] **Emotional beats**: Internal moments from character journals are woven into the prose
- [ ] **Word count target**: Within 20% of the target word count for the chapter type
- [ ] **Appropriate ending**: The chapter ends matching the specified ending type (cliffhanger, emotional beat, quiet closure, or question)

## Common Issues to Avoid

- **Information leakage**: POV character knowing things they should not
- **Mechanical language**: References to rolls, checks, HP, or game terms
- **Flat dialogue**: Everyone sounds the same, or sounds like they are reading from a script
- **Missing emotion**: Action without internal experience
- **Abrupt endings**: Chapter stops rather than concludes

## Voice Feedback Integration

When VOICE_FEEDBACK is provided, also verify:

- [ ] **Feedback addressed**: The specific feedback points have been incorporated
- [ ] **Consistency maintained**: Changes do not conflict with established tone/style
- [ ] **Balance preserved**: Adjustments have not overcorrected in the opposite direction
