# Hybrid Style

Balanced between script and novel. Clear speaker attribution with flowing prose. Best for players who want clarity without sacrificing narrative immersion.

## Format Rules

- Use `**NAME:**` inline for speaker attribution
- Use *italics* for narration and description
- Use dice symbol with `inline code` for dice rolls
- Use `*` for discoveries
- Minimal Unicode markers, prose-forward

## Example Scene

The party is questioning a dock worker named **Harwick** about suspicious cargo shipments at the **Rusty Anchor** tavern.

```
===============

*The **Rusty Anchor** is nearly empty at this hour. A single dock
worker nurses a drink in the corner, his clothes still damp from
the morning fog. He looks up warily as the party approaches.*

**Harwick:** "I don't want no trouble. Just havin' my drink."

*He's a weathered man, the kind who's spent his life hauling crates
and asking no questions. His eyes, though--his eyes are afraid.*

**Lyra:** "We're not here for trouble." *She slides a silver piece
across the table.* "We're looking for information about the shipments
coming in after midnight."

*His jaw tightens.* **Harwick:** "Don't know nothin' about that."

Dice Insight: `1d20+3 = [16]+3 = 19 vs DC 12 -> SUCCESS`

* *He's lying. His left hand grips the mug so tight his knuckles
have gone white.*

**Kira:** "Three children have gone missing in the last week. Whatever
you're afraid of, we can help. But only if you talk."

Dice Persuasion: `1d20+4 = [15]+4 = 19 vs DC 15 -> SUCCESS`

*Something shifts in **Harwick**'s expression. His shoulders drop.*

**Harwick** *(quietly)*: "There's... there's crates that come in.
After midnight, like you said. We're told not to look inside. Paid
double to forget we saw anything."

*He leans in, voice dropping to a whisper.*

**Harwick:** "Last week, one of 'em was open. Just a crack. I heard...
I heard breathing inside. I ain't touched another one since."

* The midnight shipments contain **living cargo**.
