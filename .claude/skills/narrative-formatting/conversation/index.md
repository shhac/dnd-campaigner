# Conversation Scene Formatting

Format guide for dialogue, social encounters, and NPC interactions.

## Available Styles

| Style | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Script** | `script.md` | Clear speaker labels, Unicode markers, structured and scannable |
| **Novel** | `novel.md` | Prose-based, dialogue woven into narration, literary feel |
| **Hybrid** | `hybrid.md` | Balanced approach, clear speakers with flowing prose |
| **Minimal** | `minimal.md` | Clean, less markup, streamlined presentation |

**Recommended Default:** Script or Hybrid (player preference)

Load only the chosen style file to save context.

## Common Elements (All Styles)

### NPC Introduction
When an NPC first appears, always establish their appearance and demeanor before their first line of dialogue.

### Actions During Conversation
Intersperse physical actions with dialogue to keep scenes dynamic.

### Social Skill Checks
Insert checks naturally into conversation flow. Show the roll, then the consequence.

### Multiple NPCs
Distinguish clearly between speakers regardless of style.

### Whispered/Private Speech
Note privacy in all styles:
- Script: `--- **THERON** (whispering to **Kira**) ---`
- Novel: *"I don't trust her," **Theron** whispered to **Kira**.*
- Hybrid: **Theron** *(whispering to **Kira**)*: "I don't trust her."
- Minimal: **Theron** (to **Kira**, quietly): "I don't trust her."

### Conversation Transitions
Use `---` for topic shifts in Script/Hybrid styles. In Novel/Minimal, use prose paragraph breaks.

## Choosing a Style

Ask the player at session start:

> "Which narrative style do you prefer for dialogue scenes?
> - **Script**: Structured, easy to scan, clear speaker labels
> - **Novel**: Literary prose, immersive reading experience
> - **Hybrid**: Balanced--clear speakers with flowing narration
> - **Minimal**: Clean, simple, fast to read"

Once chosen, maintain consistency throughout the session.
