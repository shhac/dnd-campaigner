## Example Scene

The party is questioning a dock worker named **Harwick** about suspicious cargo shipments at the **Rusty Anchor** tavern.

```
The Rusty Anchor is nearly empty at this hour. A dock worker nurses
a drink in the corner, clothes still damp from the morning fog.

**Harwick:** "I don't want no trouble. Just havin' my drink."

**Lyra:** "We're not here for trouble. We're looking for information
about the shipments coming in after midnight."

She slides a silver piece across the table. Harwick's eyes flick
to the coin. His jaw tightens.

**Harwick:** "Don't know nothin' about that."

`Insight 19 vs 12: Success` -- He's lying. His knuckles are white
around the mug.

**Kira:** "Three children have gone missing in the last week. Whatever
you're afraid of, we can help. But only if you talk."

`Persuasion 19 vs 15: Success`

His shoulders drop. Something like resignation crosses his face.

**Harwick:** "There's crates that come in. After midnight. We're
told not to look inside. Paid double to forget we saw anything."

He leans closer, voice barely a whisper.

**Harwick:** "Last week, one was open. Just a crack. I heard breathing
inside. I ain't touched another one since."

-- The midnight shipments contain living cargo.
