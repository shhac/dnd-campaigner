# Novel Style

Prose-based, literary, with dialogue woven naturally into narration. Best for players who prefer immersive, story-like reading.

## Format Rules

- Integrate dialogue into flowing prose
- Use **bold** for character names
- Use *italics* for internal thoughts and emphasis
- Use blockquotes `>` for particularly significant speech
- Use `inline code` for dice results, minimally displayed
- Minimal use of Unicode markers (only for major breaks)

## Example Scene

The party is questioning a dock worker named **Harwick** about suspicious cargo shipments at the **Rusty Anchor** tavern.

```
The **Rusty Anchor** was nearly empty at this hour. A single dock
worker nursed a drink in the corner, his clothes still damp from
the morning fog. He looked up warily as the party approached--**Harwick**,
the manifest had said. A man who worked the midnight shift.

"I don't want no trouble," he said, hunching over his mug. "Just
havin' my drink."

**Lyra** smiled, sliding into the seat across from him. "We're not
here for trouble." She placed a silver piece on the table between
them. "We're looking for information about the shipments coming
in after midnight."

**Harwick**'s eyes flicked to the coin, then back to her face. His
jaw tightened. "Don't know nothin' about that."

*He's lying.* `Insight: 19 vs DC 12 -> SUCCESS` His left hand gripped
the mug so tight his knuckles had gone white.

**Kira** leaned forward, her voice dropping low. "Three children
have gone missing in the last week. Whatever you're afraid of, we
can help. But only if you talk."

`Persuasion: 19 vs DC 15 -> SUCCESS`

Something shifted in **Harwick**'s expression. His shoulders dropped,
the fear bleeding into something like resignation. When he spoke
again, his voice was barely above a whisper.

"There's crates that come in. After midnight, like you said. We're
told not to look inside. Paid double to forget we saw anything."

He glanced toward the door, as if expecting someone to be listening,
then leaned closer.

> "Last week, one of 'em was open. Just a crack. I heard breathing
> inside. I ain't touched another one since."

*Living cargo.* The implication settled over the party like a shroud.
