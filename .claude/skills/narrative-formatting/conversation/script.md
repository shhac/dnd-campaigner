## Example Scene

The party is questioning a dock worker named **Harwick** about suspicious cargo shipments at the **Rusty Anchor** tavern.

```
* *The **Rusty Anchor** is nearly empty at this hour. A single dock
worker nurses a drink in the corner, his clothes still damp from
the morning fog. He looks up warily as you approach.*

--- **HARWICK** (Dock Worker) ---
"I don't want no trouble. Just havin' my drink."

--- **LYRA** ---
"We're not here for trouble. We're looking for information about
the shipments coming in after midnight."

-> ***Lyra*** *slides a silver piece across the table.*

* ***Harwick***'s *eyes flick to the coin, then back to **Lyra**.
His jaw tightens.*

--- **HARWICK** ---
"Don't know nothin' about that."

Dice Insight: `1d20+3 = [16]+3 = 19 vs DC 12 -> SUCCESS`

* *He's lying--and badly. His left hand grips his mug so tight his
knuckles have gone white.*

--- **KIRA** ---
"Three children have gone missing in the last week. Whatever you're
afraid of, we can help. But only if you talk."

Dice Persuasion: `1d20+4 = [15]+4 = 19 vs DC 15 -> SUCCESS`

* *Something shifts in **Harwick**'s expression. His shoulders drop,
the fear bleeding into something like resignation.*

--- **HARWICK** (quietly) ---
"There's... there's crates that come in. After midnight, like you
said. We're told not to look inside. Paid double to forget we saw
anything."

-> ***Harwick*** *leans in closer, voice dropping to a whisper.*

--- **HARWICK** ---
"Last week, one of 'em was open. Just a crack. I heard... I heard
breathing inside. I ain't touched another one since."

* The midnight shipments contain **living cargo**.
