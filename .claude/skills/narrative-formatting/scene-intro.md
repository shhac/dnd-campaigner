# Scene Introduction Formatting

Format guide for opening scenes, transitions, and establishing shots.

## Markdown Conventions

- **Bold** location names and important places: `**Thornwood Manor**`, `**Millhaven**`
- **Bold** character names: `**Captain Voss**`, `**Kira**`
- *Italic* for atmospheric descriptions: `*The estate looms against the grey sky.*`
- `Inline code` for dice roll results (when applicable)
- Keep Unicode symbols (★, ═══) as visual markers

## Major Scene Break

Use for significant location changes, time skips, or chapter boundaries:

```
═══════════════════

*Three days later, the walls of **Millhaven** rise from the morning mist...*

═══════════════════
```

## Scene Title (Optional)

For named locations or significant moments:

```
═══════════════════
**THE THORNWOOD MANOR**
═══════════════════

★ *The estate looms against the grey sky, its windows dark as
empty eye sockets. The iron gate hangs open, rust bleeding down
its bars.*
```

## Time Establishment

Open with when, then where:

```
═══════════════════

★ *Dawn breaks cold and grey over the city. You've been walking
for an hour, and the **Dockside Ward** is finally coming to life
around you—fishmongers setting up stalls, dockhands trudging
toward the piers.*
```

## Location Establishment

Paint the setting before action begins:

```
═══════════════════
**THE RUSTY ANCHOR TAVERN**
═══════════════════

★ *Pipe smoke hangs thick in the air. The tavern's common room
is half-full despite the early hour—sailors, dockworkers, and
harder sorts nursing their drinks in the dim light filtering
through greasy windows.*
```

## Atmosphere and Mood

Use sensory details:

```
★ *The temperature drops as you descend. The air grows damp,
carrying the mineral smell of deep stone and something else—
something organic and wrong. Your torchlight seems to shrink,
pushed back by the pressing dark.*
```

## NPC Presence

Introduce who's already there:

```
★ *The guard captain's office is cramped and cluttered. Maps
cover every wall, pins marking locations you don't recognize.
Behind the desk sits **Captain Voss**, her scarred face lit by a
single candle. She doesn't look up as you enter.*

━━━ **CAPTAIN VOSS** ━━━
"Close the door. What you're about to hear doesn't leave this room."
```

## Transition from Previous Scene

Connect to what came before:

```
═══════════════════

★ *You leave the magistrate's office with more questions than
answers. The sun has set while you were inside, and **Millhaven**'s
streets have taken on their nighttime character—fewer merchants,
more shadows.*

★ *The **Undercroft** lies ahead. According to **Marta**, that's where
you'll find the **Rat King**.*
```

## Minor Transitions

For brief shifts within a scene:

```
───

★ *An hour passes. The tavern empties as the night grows late,
until only your party and the barkeep remain.*

───
```

## Time Skip

```
═══════════════════

★ *You make camp in the ruins, taking watches through the night.
Nothing disturbs your rest—though none of you sleep well.*

★ *Morning comes reluctantly, grey light seeping through the
broken roof.*

═══════════════════
```

## Weather and Environment

```
═══════════════════

★ *Rain has been falling for three days. The roads have become
rivers of mud, and the forest trail you're following is barely
visible beneath the flooding.*

★ *Through the downpour, you spot lights ahead—a village, finally.*
```

## Arriving at a Destination

```
═══════════════════
**BLACKWATER CROSSING**
═══════════════════

★ *The village is smaller than the map suggested—a handful of
buildings clustered around a stone bridge. Smoke rises from
perhaps a dozen chimneys. The largest structure is clearly the
inn, its sign swinging in the wind: **The Crossed Swords**.*

★ *A group of villagers gathered near the well fall silent as
you approach. Their eyes follow you with a mix of curiosity and
something harder to read.*
```

## Full Example: Scene Opening

```
═══════════════════
**THE UNDERCROFT**
═══════════════════

★ *The flood gate groans as you force it open. Beyond lies
darkness—the kind that swallows torchlight whole.*

★ *You're beneath the city now. The tunnels here are old, older
than **Millhaven** itself. The stonework is crumbling, held together
by rootlike growths that pulse faintly in your torchlight. The
air is thick, wet, and carries the smell of rot.*

★ ***Marta*** *said to go past the third flood gate. You've passed the
first. The tunnel splits ahead—left, into deeper darkness; right,
toward the sound of running water.*

───

→ ***Kira*** *crouches at the intersection, examining the ground.*

★ *Footprints in the slime. Multiple sets, going both directions.
Some are fresh.*

━━━ **KIRA** (quietly) ━━━
"We're not alone down here."
```

## Session Opening

For starting a new play session:

```
═══════════════════
**SESSION 4: INTO THE ROT**
═══════════════════

★ *Previously: You discovered the **Thornwood family**'s connection
to the disappearances and tracked the cult's activities to the
old sewer network beneath **Millhaven**.*

★ *We rejoin our heroes at the entrance to the **Undercroft**,
torches lit, weapons ready...*

═══════════════════

★ *The darkness ahead seems to breathe.*
```
