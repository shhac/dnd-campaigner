# D&D Rules Reference

Quick reference for common D&D 5e mechanics.

## NPC Attitudes

Track NPC disposition on this scale:

**Hostile -> Unfriendly -> Neutral -> Friendly -> Helpful**

| Attitude | Behavior | Social DC Modifier |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Hostile** | Actively works against party, may attack | +10 to DCs |
| **Unfriendly** | Suspicious, unhelpful, may obstruct | +5 to DCs |
| **Neutral** | Indifferent, transactional | Base DC |
| **Friendly** | Cooperative, willing to help within reason | -2 to DCs |
| **Helpful** | Goes out of their way to assist | -5 to DCs |

**Shifting Attitudes:**
- Good roleplay and persuasion can shift attitudes one step
- Exceptional actions (saving their life, large bribes) can shift two steps
- Some NPCs have fixed attitudes based on faction or history
- Betrayal or insult typically shifts attitude two steps toward hostile

## Rest Mechanics

### Short Rest (1 hour)

- **Hit Dice Recovery**: Spend Hit Dice to heal (roll HD + CON mod per die spent)
- **Class Abilities**: Some abilities recharge:
  - Fighter: Second Wind, Action Surge
  - Warlock: Spell slots (Pact Magic)
  - Bard: Bardic Inspiration (at level 5+)
  - Monk: Ki points
  - Druid: Wild Shape uses (at level 20)

### Long Rest (8 hours)

- **HP**: Restore all hit points
- **Hit Dice**: Regain spent Hit Dice (up to half your total, minimum 1)
- **Spell Slots**: Restore all spell slots
- **Daily Abilities**: Reset most abilities:
  - Channel Divinity
  - Rage uses
  - Superiority Dice
  - Wild Shape uses
  - Daily-use magic items
- **Limitation**: Can only benefit from one long rest per 24 hours
- **Interruption**: Must have at least 1 hour of rest; combat or strenuous activity (1+ hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, etc.) interrupts the rest

## Encounter Difficulty

Theater-of-mind guidance for balancing encounters:

| Difficulty | Description | Expected Outcome |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Easy** | Minimal challenge | Little to no resource use, negligible risk |
| **Medium** | Moderate challenge | Some resources spent, possible minor HP loss |
| **Hard** | Significant challenge | Resource drain likely, risk of unconsciousness |
| **Deadly** | Potentially lethal | Real character death risk, party may need to retreat |

### Adjusting Difficulty

Consider these factors when setting encounter difficulty:

**Increase Difficulty When:**
- Party is well-rested with full resources
- Party has tactical advantages (surprise, terrain)
- Story moment calls for high stakes

**Decrease Difficulty When:**
- Party is low on resources (HP, spell slots, abilities)
- Party is split or missing members
- Multiple encounters without rest opportunity

**Environmental Modifiers:**
- Hazardous terrain adds effective difficulty
- Time pressure limits tactical options
- Darkness/concealment affects combat balance

### Resource Pacing

For a typical adventuring day:
- 6-8 medium/hard encounters with 2 short rests
- Or 2-3 hard/deadly encounters with 1 short rest
- Adjust based on narrative pacing needs
