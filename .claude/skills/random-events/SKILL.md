# Random Events Skill

Use this skill to inject unpredictability into sessions. The world should feel alive and dynamic, not scripted.

## When to Use

- **Session start**: Weather, any news/rumors in the air
- **Travel**: Encounters, discoveries, environmental events
- **Social scenes**: NPC moods, tavern events, rumors
- **Downtime**: What happens while they rest
- **When stuck**: Need inspiration for what happens next

## Weather & Environment

Roll `toss 1d20` at session start or when weather might change:

### Temperate Weather
| Roll | Weather | Game Effect |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 1-2 | Severe Storm | Disadvantage on Perception, travel speed halved, possible shelter needed |
| 3-5 | Heavy Rain | Disadvantage on ranged attacks, tracks washed away, fires hard to start |
| 6-8 | Light Rain/Overcast | Dim light, dampens sounds (+2 to Stealth) |
| 9-14 | Pleasant | No mechanical effect |
| 15-17 | Clear & Bright | Excellent visibility, +2 to Navigation |
| 18-19 | Extreme Temperature | CON saves (DC 10) per hour of exposure or gain exhaustion |
| 20 | Dramatic Event | Roll on Dramatic Weather below |

### Dramatic Weather (roll 1d6)
1. Sudden thick fog (heavily obscured beyond 30 ft)
2. Freak hailstorm (1d4 bludgeoning per minute exposed)
3. Earthquake tremor (DEX save DC 12 or prone, structures may be damaged)
4. Unnatural silence (no sound carries beyond 10 ft - magical?)
5. Strange lights in sky (aurora, shooting stars, omens)
6. Weather changes impossibly fast (clear to storm in minutes - something magical)

## Travel Encounters

Roll `toss 1d20` per significant travel segment:

### Roads & Settled Areas
| Roll | Encounter |
|------|-----------|
| 1 | Ambush (bandits, monsters, or hostile faction) |
| 2-3 | Obstacle (bridge out, rockslide, flooded road) |
| 4-6 | Travelers (merchants, pilgrims, patrol, refugees) |
| 7-9 | Discovery (abandoned camp, roadside shrine, strange sight) |
| 10-14 | Uneventful journey |
| 15-17 | Helpful encounter (friendly traveler shares info, shortcut found) |
| 18-19 | Opportunity (something valuable spotted, work offered) |
| 20 | Plot hook (directly connects to campaign story) |

### Wilderness
| Roll | Encounter |
|------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Hostile creatures (appropriate to terrain and party level) |
| 3-4 | Environmental hazard (quicksand, unstable ground, toxic plants, cliff) |
| 5-7 | Wildlife (neutral, could go either way based on party actions) |
| 8-10 | Discovery (ruins, old campsite, natural wonder, bones) |
| 11-14 | Uneventful |
| 15-16 | Tracks/signs (something passed through - what and when?) |
| 17-18 | Resources (fresh water, forageable food, natural shelter) |
| 19 | Mysterious (something unexplained, hooks curiosity) |
| 20 | Major discovery (dungeon entrance, hidden settlement, artifact) |

## Rumors & News

When characters ask around or visit taverns, roll `toss 1d6` for rumor quality:

| Roll | Quality |
|------|---------|
| 1 | False - Completely wrong, possibly dangerous misinformation |
| 2 | Exaggerated - Kernel of truth, wildly blown out of proportion |
| 3 | Outdated - Was true, now resolved or changed |
| 4 | Local gossip - True but trivial, local color |
| 5 | Useful intel - True and relevant to party interests |
| 6 | Plot hook - Directly connects to campaign/character backstories |

### Rumor Topic (roll 1d12)
1. Monster sighting nearby
2. Crime or theft in the area
3. Political tension or news from afar
4. Strange occurrences, omens, supernatural events
5. Economic news (shortages, price changes, trade disruption)
6. Religious events or proclamations
7. Famous person spotted or arriving
8. Upcoming event, festival, or gathering
9. Faction conflict or movement
10. Lost treasure, hidden wealth, mysterious inheritance
11. Missing persons, unexplained disappearances
12. Something touching a PC's backstory (roll to pick which PC)

## NPC Mood

When meeting an NPC whose attitude isn't established, roll `toss 1d20`:

| Roll | Starting Mood | Behavior |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 1-2 | Hostile | Rude, obstructive, may become aggressive |
| 3-5 | Unfriendly | Curt, unhelpful, provides bare minimum |
| 6-8 | Indifferent | Neutral, transactional, no extra effort |
| 9-14 | Professional | Normal helpful service, nothing special |
| 15-17 | Friendly | Warm, shares a bit extra, minor favors |
| 18-19 | Very Helpful | Goes out of their way, offers information freely |
| 20 | Exceptionally Disposed | Has something specifically useful for the party |

Modify based on: reputation, faction relations, race relations, party appearance, time of day.

## Location-Specific Events

### Tavern Events (roll 1d20 when spending time)

| 1 | Bar fight breaks out nearby |
| 2-3 | Drunk patron bothers the party |
| 4-5 | Entertainment performs (bard, storyteller, game) |

## Session Start Routine

Quick rolls to establish the day:
1. Weather: `toss 1d20` (consult weather table)
2. News in the air: `toss 1d6` (rumor quality) + `toss 1d12` (topic) if relevant
3. General vibe: Is anything unusual happening in the area?

## Integrating Results

Random doesn't mean disconnected. When you roll a result:
1. **Filter through campaign context** - A "monster sighting" could be the cult's creatures
2. **Connect to existing threads** - The "mysterious stranger" could be a faction agent
3. **Use as prompts, not mandates** - Results inspire, but you shape them to fit
4. **Escalate interesting results** - A nat 20 deserves special attention

The goal is a world that feels alive beyond the party's actions, with surprises even the GM didn't plan.
