# Concentration Saves

Maintaining concentration on spells during combat.

## When to Roll

A concentration save is triggered when:
- Character takes damage while concentrating on a spell

## The Save

**Type:** Constitution saving throw

**DC:** 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher

| Damage | DC |
|--------|-----|
| 1-21 | 10 |
| 22+ | Half damage |

## Resolution

- **Success:** Spell continues
- **Failure:** Spell ends immediately

## Multiple Damage Sources

If hit by multiple damage sources simultaneously (e.g., dragon breath + fall damage), make a separate save for each source.

## Tracking

Note active concentration spells:

```
**Active Concentration**
- Seraphine: Bless (3 targets)
- Enemy Mage: Hold Person on Grimjaw
```

When damage is dealt to a concentrating character, always resolve the concentration save before continuing.
