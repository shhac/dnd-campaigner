# Combat Narration

Techniques for narrating combat with multiple AI players.

## Batching AI Actions

When multiple AI players act, weave their actions together:

**Individual (choppy):**
> Grimjaw attacks the orc. He hits for 9 damage.
> Tilda attacks the orc. She hits for 14 damage.
> Seraphine casts Sacred Flame. The orc fails, takes 7 damage.

**Batched (flowing):**
> Grimjaw's axe finds the orc's shoulder (Attack: 18, Hit! 9 damage). Tilda slips behind, blade seeking gaps in armor (Attack: 21, Hit! 14 damage with Sneak Attack). Seraphine invokes her goddess, sacred flame descending on the wounded creature (DEX save failed, 7 radiant).

## Show Your Work

Include mechanical results but keep them unobtrusive:

```
Grimjaw swings his greataxe in a brutal overhead arc.
**Attack:** 1d20+6 = [14]+6 = 20 vs AC 15 - **Hit!**
**Damage:** 2d6+4 = [5,3]+4 = 12 slashing

The orc staggers, blood streaming from the wound.
```

## Cutting to Human Player

At dramatic moments, cut to the human player:

> The chieftain roars, blood streaming from Tilda's strike. He raises his greataxe, eyes locked on YOU.
>
> **What do you do?**

## Round Summaries

At end of round, brief status update:

```
**End of Round 2:**
- Orc Chieftain: Bloodied (roughly half HP)
- Orc Warriors: 1 dead, 2 wounded
- Party: Grimjaw took 8 damage, others unharmed
```

## Describing Conditions

When conditions apply, weave into narrative:

**Prone:**
> Grimjaw's charge knocks the bandit flat. The man scrambles on the ground, trying to rise.

**Grappled:**
> The ogre's massive hand closes around Tilda, pinning her arms. She struggles but can't break free.

**Concentration:**
> Seraphine's eyes glow as she maintains her spell, divine energy flowing into her allies.

## Narrating AI Player Actions

Match their character voice:

**Grimjaw (aggressive, direct):**
> Grimjaw bellows a war cry and charges, axe raised. "Die, scum!"

**Tilda (tactical, quiet):**
> Tilda melts into the shadows, circling for position. A flash of steel, and her blade finds the archer's throat.

**Seraphine (faithful, protective):**
> "The Light shields us!" Seraphine's prayer manifests as golden radiance washing over her wounded allies.

## Opportunity Attacks

Narrate opportunity attacks as interrupts:

> The goblin turns to flee—
>
> Grimjaw's axe whips out reflexively. **Opportunity Attack:** 1d20+6 = 22, Hit! 10 damage.
>
> The goblin crumples before taking a step.

## Failed Actions

Make failures interesting:

**Miss:**
> Tilda's blade skitters off the knight's armor, sparks flying. She curses and dances back.

**Failed Save:**
> Seraphine raises her shield against the dragon's breath, but the flames overwhelm her. She screams as fire washes over her (28 fire damage).

**Spell Resisted:**
> The necromancer's eyes glow as Corwin's spell washes over him—then he laughs. "Pathetic." (Legendary Resistance used)
